> “(…) any shared experience adds richness to your copy of their strange loop, sometimes so much so that it feels inextricably tied to your own, they become a part of you, a soulmate. It’s a beautiful notion one which Hofstadter grappled with in the wake of his wife’s sudden death at 42. Her body was gone but he refused to accept the notion that she had been erased completely. After all there were letters and photos and videos that survived, relics that contain elements of who she once was. Most of all she remained in the minds of everyone who knew her. Hundreds of copies of her original strange loop distributed across a network of friends and family and yes, those people would die someday, too. But it helps to combat the totality of her death. It’s a beautiful notion, a community keeping rough copies of your strange loop after you’ve died.” – [You Are A Strange Loop](https://youtu.be/hQsnHkfs3sA?t=1095)


First of all, I want to thank **[Jörn Röder](https://web.archive.org/web/20190824153351/http://joernroeder.de/)** for all the intellectual ping-pongs, night-shifts, collaborations and learning processes throughout the past years. You are the reason why I was able to level-up in the "machine distance hierarchy" from "power-user" to "researcher". Probably one of my greatest, most intellectually demanding achievements. But now, all the ingredients are there!

A special thanks to visiting professor **[Hans Bernhard](https://web.archive.org/web/20190914175503/http://ubermorgen.com/)** for helping me to develop my critical thinking approaches and methodologies and for your personal guidance throughout my reconfiguration within the institution. This was such a fundamental change, I probably wouldn't have made it this far without your truly unique character.

Furthermore, I want to thank **[Rosa Menkman](https://web.archive.org/web/20190704203513/https://beyondresolution.info/)** for providing me – just-in-time before the finish line – the necessary context and perspective for my work while I couldn't figure out what I was actually doing. And of course, thanks for all the extra hours of discussion throughout my messy process and exploration. Sorry, for all the context-switches, but once you know the patterns, you see them everywhere..

I want to thank all three of you for helping me to shape my perspectives – I think you are brilliant thinkers and inspiring personalities and I am grateful to had the opportunity to learn from and with you!

I also want to thank **[Jan Peters](https://web.archive.org/web/20190419094041/https://www.kunsthochschulekassel.de/personen/personen-details/person/peters-jan.html)** for stepping in as an examiner for this project and making my graduation possible!

Particularly, I would like to thank my family for giving me the love, trust, time and patience to let me explore and discover my own way!
You always say that this is self-evident for you, but I don't want to take it for granted!

And of course, a big thanks to my close friends that supported me emotionally throughout this highly volatile journey of mine. Sorry for not answering the phone!

In the end, I want to thank **[Joel Baumann](https://web.archive.org/web/20191118075303/https://joelbaumann.com/)** and the **[School of Art and Desing Kassel](https://web.archive.org/web/20191114174136/https://www.kunsthochschulekassel.de/willkommen.html)** for giving me access to this space for experimentation, learning and discovery as well as the fast internet connection for downloading all that content that made my research possible. I partially used a VPN – so don't worry!

And last but not least, thanks to the alumi of the **[New Media](https://web.archive.org/web/20181021232256/http://www.newmediakassel.com:80/)** class for your works, shared experiences and inspirations along the way.
