# Rebalancing Verticality

We won't get rid of verticals, but we can change their capacities, reduce their extend of influence.
extend the entity-based machine layer, reduce the extend of platform-owned identities. The hierarchies will still exist, but to a lower degree. hyperlinks subvert hierarchies! identity as to be build application-specific now, "account", "user" of each service.

and why TikTok may be excluded > too software / network-specific and fast paced? > why even archive?


The innovation has now come from the most basic infrastructures, and it is going to be developed on open source platforms or operating systems first, because it is the most appropriate layer for integration in combination with the browser. (?)

only with payment comes expectations, rights and privileges (voice), we expect things to be free on the internet > consumer problem
tradeoff: "free software with ads to make up the difference" > "undefined grey area between who is the consumer, the customer and how much of a product are you a part of" > payment and subscription

Cyclic nature
unbundling and bundling
Packets (verticals) will be split, and then reconfigured (new vertical)
40:00 mp3 unbundled albums and bundled them into a Playlist
Vertical integration to modularization and back


peer-to-peer is inevitable because it will be the most cost-efficient variant of information exchange:
p2p: costs = (filesize / customer) x cost-per-byte
CDNs: costs = filesize x customer x cost-per-byte
