- notes to power-laws, network effects, etc.


### Pareto Principle (1896)
- long tail
- 80/20
- power law that exists in every market

### Metcalfes Law (1993)
- george gilder referencing the inventor of ethernet
- value=n^2
- defines the theoretical value of a network
- ecosystems create more value than each component on its own

### Goldilocks Principle (1837)
- just the right amount, best place for learning, motivation and challenge

### "Zuckerberg's Law" (2012)
Zuckerbergs's law is the observation that the bandwidth of communication in a social network doubles about every year.

### Conway's Law (1967)
> “Any organization that designs a system (defined more broadly here than just information systems) will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.”

### "The Mirroring Hypothesis"
> "product developed by the loosely-coupled organization is significantly more modular than the product from the tightly-coupled organization"

### Kuhn's Paradigm Shift (1962)
> "Paradigm shifts arise when the dominant paradigm under which normal science operates is rendered incompatible with new phenomena, facilitating the adoption of a new theory or paradigm."

### Technology Adoption Life Cycle (1957)
- Adoption Curve, normal distribution, psychographics
- innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, laggards
- the diffusion process

### Machine-Distance (2019)
The "length" between an abstract, technical function and the person who interacts with it.
Researcher > Developer > Administrator > Power-User > End-User

### Vertical Integration
- unifying function, internalizing

### Horizontal Integration
- cooperating function, externalizing, modularization

### Flow Optimization
- workflow, optimal experience, continuity, circulation, throughput, bandwidth, density

### Interplanetary Filesystem (IPFS)
