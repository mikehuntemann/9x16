# TikTok Takeover
> Notes to video work, memable content

> better than language
> Democratization of mobile video production
> music as the baseline

TikTok musically bootstrapping out of viral, platform branded content within “general purpose” networks > facebook, twitter, reddit 

> bootstrapping from virality and music verticality 
> dont judge (2015) vs karma is a bitch (2018)
> who owns the meme?
> cooperation vs competition

> Geneology, Ideas, Patterns, Time
> genre, variation and anti-genre
>>expectation, surprise and disruption
 
> challenge vs meme?
> "normis"

Virality is a form of synchronization
> rhythm
> repetition
> habit
> as a means of survival
> what wants to survive?
> the idea, the construct, the pattern, the network



Abundant tools of production, scarce meme (?)
 > collective experience / participation > brand exposure within meme (hard to predict)

compliation as a platform


Nature prefers simplicity and symmetry

“ByteDance has accumulated a vast amount of content and social media created by people and rich engagement data across our various products. This massive data is fed into our machine learning algorithms, which further refines the quality of users’ content feed and enhances the content experience, which in turn encourages more engagement and generates more data to be fed back into our algorithms. We use this virtuous cycle to optimize every stage of the “content lifecycle”—creation, moderation, curation, recommendation and interaction.”
