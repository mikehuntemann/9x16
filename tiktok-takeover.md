# TikTok Takeover
> Notes to video work, memable content

> better than language
> Democratization of mobile video production
> music as the baseline

TikTok musically bootstrapping out of viral, platform branded content within “general purpose” networks > facebook, twitter, reddit 

> bootstrapping from virality and music verticality 
> dont judge (2015) vs karma is a bitch (2018)
> who owns the meme?
> cooperation vs competition

> Geneology, Ideas, Patterns, Time
> genre, variation and anti-genre
>>expectation, surprise and disruption
 
> challenge vs meme?
> "normis"

Virality is a form of synchronization
> rhythm
> repetition
> habit
> as a means of survival
> what wants to survive?
> the idea, the construct, the pattern, the network



Abundant tools of production, scarce meme (?)
 > collective experience / participation > brand exposure within meme (hard to predict)

compliation as a platform


Nature prefers simplicity and symmetry 


plot twist
