# TikTok Takeover
- Notes to video work, memable content

- better than language
- Democratization of mobile video production
- music as the baseline

TikTok musically bootstrapping out of viral, platform branded content within “general purpose” networks > facebook, twitter, reddit 

- bootstrapping from virality and music verticality 
- dont judge (2015) vs karma is a bitch (2018)
- who owns the meme?
- cooperation vs competition

- Geneology, Ideas, Patterns, Time
- genre, variation and anti-genre
	- expectation, surprise and disruption
 
- challenge vs meme?
- "normis"

Virality is a form of synchronization
- "micro-singularities"

- rhythm
- repetition
- habit
- as a means of survival
- what wants to survive?
- the idea, the construct, the pattern, the network


Abundant tools of production, scarce meme (?)
 > collective experience / participation > brand exposure within meme (hard to predict)

compliation as a platform


"Nature prefers simplicity and symmetry" 

general editing patterns:
one-take
plot-twisting (binary states) directed by "drop"
more complex sequences directed by rhythm

general evolutionary patterns:
genre / "gerne-iteration" / anti-gerne
conform or copy / enhance or reimagine / fight
expected / surprised / broken

plus media internal reactions

“ByteDance has accumulated a vast amount of content and social media created by people and rich engagement data across our various products. This massive data is fed into our machine learning algorithms, which further refines the quality of users’ content feed and enhances the content experience, which in turn encourages more engagement and generates more data to be fed back into our algorithms. We use this virtuous cycle to optimize every stage of the “content lifecycle”—creation, moderation, curation, recommendation and interaction.”

Elephant in the brain: Chapter Communication
Visual communication in vertical mediums > body language / performance
> other way of expression, richer, more bandwidth
Hosting a thought > the parasitic nature of the meme


the role of sound hits steyerl’s work:
>“One of the reasons [that sound is so vital for the work] is that usually there is such an array of confusing and very very different sources of material which have almost nothing to do with one another even though I pretend. But the only reason why are people able to somehow pretend they go along with this fiction is because the music somehow provides a pretext for doing so. So it unifies, it creates the narrative basically.” - "What is Contemprary? A conversation with Hito Steyerl" published by MOCA (Feb, 2016)
