### "Document, Don't Create" 
by GaryVee

“People aren’t starting. They’re just not making. They’re thinking, they’re pondering, they’re strategizing, they’re debating.”


“I think Vlogging is very fascinating. You should be doing **Instagram** stories and **Snapchat** stories at scale. You should be putting out seven to 25 pieces of content on both those platforms a day. 
Let me explain how. Don’t go fancy. Document versus create. It’s a big shift. When I say seven to 25, you say: “My god. How do I produce seven to 25 meaningful things that will have me respected”, versus document. You got to put out stuff. And you got to fabricate it. (…) There is no excuse for not talking to the world, it just doesn’t have to be your thoughts and words every time.”

### "10 YouTube Fundaments"
“Your views tend to look like this. One huge spike and then back to normal.” 

“That’s why to have long term success with your channel, it’s important to come up with ideas that are repeatable and one way to do that is in the form of a show or series (…) None of these are absolutely necessary but each can help grow that loyal fan base that comes back again and again.”

- Shareability: idea that is easy to communicate
- Conversation: direct communication
- Interactivity: community integration
- Consistency: brand recognition
- Targeting: community centered
- Sustainability: predictability
- Discoverability: popular topics and "evergreens"
- Accessibility: easy to understand for new viewers
- Collaboration: expanding community
- Inspiration: try something new


“If we can’t shoot at least three episodes in one day, we move on to the next idea.”

“They are talking about block shooting here, the practice of recording several videos all at once that you can release over time. (…) If you want to be sustainable, think about how you can make lighter, less time consuming videos. (…) Now look, you can of course make stuff with higher production value but it’s a good idea to also have a second, easier to make series to keep your fans engaged.”

### Kevin B. Lee on Video Essays

“If you want me to make viral videos then I need to make videos about viral subjects.”

“Stanley Kubrick, viral subject. I mean it’s really unfair because popular film-makers lead to popular videos. It’s a self-perpetuating cycle. If you want to make a popular video just make one about Tarantino or Martin Scorsese and people will watch it. It doesn’t matter how bad the video is. People will watch it anyway.”

### Chris Anderson on Pareto Distribution

“It is a power law also known as a Pareto curve (…) because it is named after Vilfredo Pareto a 19th century Italian economist who observed the entire Italian economy that 20% of the population had 80% of the wealth. (…) He was thinking that the socialist model would flatten that curve and make a more even distribution but it turns out that the Pareto curve is not an artifact. It is not a mistake, it is not a social construct created out of elitism. It turns out the be the natural shape of every market. (…) Virtually every marketplace distributes this way and you have a small number of hits and a large number of (…) niche products.”

“The conventional way of measuring media impact and power is based on circulation and readership (…) but there is a new way of measuring media impact and that is based on incoming links. This is the way Google measures and decides what is going to show up first and your results is based on Page Rank. (…) It is simply based on incoming links. So incoming links are the new coin of the realm, they are sort of the economy of reputation that determents where the traffic goes and who has influences online.”
