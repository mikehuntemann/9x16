Why you can not win by competing with FB or Bitcoin?
> "The only way you can fail is from the inside. It has to fail because of a critical vulnerability that can not be fixed or that people don’t want to fix. It has to fail because of a failure of community, trust or culture. And that is very difficult to do with a technology that has so many participants, who have so many different motivations, different cultures, different languages, different operating systems, different software platforms, all collaborating around one core basic set of ideas. They have all be disappointed for all the different reasons.”




hosting & identity need to be application / platform independent
> need for digital money aka bitcoin
> further atomization of content
> markets / economic incentives to provide decentralized / autonomous infrastructure

unbundling and bundling
Packets (verticals) will be split, and then reconfigured (new vertical)
40:00 mp3 unbundled albums and bundled them into a Playlist

46:15 why do we have databases? We want things to persist
> we had persistence long before we had (relational) databases > unix style directory structures (hierarchical)
A good architecture maximizes the number of decisions not made!
> not application dependent, exchange formats (e.g. markdown)


Constraints from new encryption based protocols that limit the capabilities of data usage > you can not verify what Facebook is actually doing with data
