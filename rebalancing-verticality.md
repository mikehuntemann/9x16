# Rebalancing Verticality

We won't get rid of verticals, but we can change their capacities, reduce their extend of influence.

### The Hosting Problem

The corporate database, the data silo and the single point of access and failure is the invention of Oracle in the 1970s. They were marketing the protection of the companies data as valuable assets. 
Since then, the previously

46:15 why do we have databases? We want things to persist
> we had persistence long before we had (relational) databases > unix style directory structures (hierarchical)
A good architecture maximizes the number of decisions not made!
> not application dependent, exchange formats (e.g. markdown)
http used location based addressing > domain to ip 
centralized location = single point of failure
404 Error - Not found
**IPFS (2015)**
content addressing = stable
“You must be shapeless, formless, like water”
Information architecture to be responsive to final rendering
we see notions of this in the movement and adoption of responsive websites as well as media content productions for several social media networks.


hosting & identity need to be application / platform independent
> need for digital money aka bitcoin
> further atomization of content
> markets / economic incentives to provide decentralized / autonomous infrastructure

### The Roadmap from Centralized to Decentralized  

Why you can not win by competing directly with Facebook or Bitcoin?
> "The only way you can fail is from the inside. It has to fail because of a critical vulnerability that can not be fixed or that people don’t want to fix. It has to fail because of a failure of community, trust or culture. And that is very difficult to do with a technology that has so many participants, who have so many different motivations, different cultures, different languages, different operating systems, different software platforms, all collaborating around one core basic set of ideas. They have all be disappointed for all the different reasons.” – Andreas M. Antonopoulos

“Any organization that designs a system will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.” - Conway's Law (1967)

This means that institutions and companies today will always replicate themselves in their services, as long as there will be a new constellation and formation of cooperation: decentralized organizations will naturally lead to decentralized services.

Or as Michael Hammer explains it in "Reengineering the Corporation (1993)": Product innovation needs also an innovation in the process of creating them. And the invention of Bitcoin leads by example:

>"A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990's. I hope it's obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system." - Satoshi Nakamoto 

Instead of giving companies the ability to become a central authority we can create protocols that restrict the same companies the ownership of "data-assets" that should ultimately belong to the sovereign individual and therefore minimizes the trust you have to give a company as a "user" and maximize trust, stability and persistance into the underlying protocol itself.

Today it is not possible to verify what the Facebooks and the Googles are actually doing with the data in their systems. In the future, there will be as a result of this new paradigm of encryption-based protocols.

>“We can not solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them.” –Albert Einstein

Or in this case, you can not solve the problems with the same stack of technologies that created them. When the flaws (privacy, surveillance, anti-trust, etc.) of today's internet are that fundamental, we won't solve them by iteration ("self-regulation" by companies) or legislation (regulation by nation states). The flaws are all symptoms of the underlying structure. So the shift has to come from the bottom up, integrated and adopted step by step, bit by bit, byte by byte.

And if everything is naturally a cylce, then all empires must fall eventually, because history is repeating itself. They are waves.

only with payment comes expectations, rights and priviliges (voice), we expect things to be free on the internet > consumer problem
