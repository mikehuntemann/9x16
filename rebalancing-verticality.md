# Rebalancing Verticality

“We can not solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them.” –Albert Einstein

-> You can not solve the problems with the same stack of technology that created them.

Why you can not win by competing with FB or Bitcoin?
> "The only way you can fail is from the inside. It has to fail because of a critical vulnerability that can not be fixed or that people don’t want to fix. It has to fail because of a failure of community, trust or culture. And that is very difficult to do with a technology that has so many participants, who have so many different motivations, different cultures, different languages, different operating systems, different software platforms, all collaborating around one core basic set of ideas. They have all be disappointed for all the different reasons.” 





hosting & identity need to be application / platform independent
> need for digital money aka bitcoin
> further atomization of content
> markets / economic incentives to provide decentralized / autonomous infrastructure

only with payment comes expectations, rights and priviliges (voice), we expect things to be free on the internet > consumer problem
tradeoff: "free software with ads to make up the difference" > "undefinded grey area between who is the consumer, the customer and how much of a product are you a part of" > payment and subscription

unbundling and bundling
Packets (verticals) will be split, and then reconfigured (new vertical)

Missing incentive structure for offering content on torrents + upload capacity was asymmetrical to download
> changed in the last few years, download and upload a symmetric now

46:15 why do we have databases? We want things to persist
> we had persistence long before we had (relational) databases > unix style directory structures (hierarchical)
A good architecture maximizes the number of decisions not made!

Constraints from new encryption based protocols that limit the capabilities of data usage > you can not verify what Facebook is actually doing with data

http used location based addressing > domain to ip 
centralized location = single point of failure

centralized organizations to decentralized organizations / teams / individuals

"A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990's. I hope it's obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system." - Satoshi Nakamoto 

snowden: exploitation of identity because every major transaction of ownership requires the identity for authorities 

"I think one of the biggest vulnerablities in our systems, the vulnerabilities that are being exploited by all of these forces is identity. In the modern world we are not permitted a sense of ownership without identity, to be able to make a trade (...) you have to use a card, the card is connected to your bank account and that goes on. If you are trying to buy something like property, how are they even register that? They need you to show your ID, they need you to get it stamped, you go to the people at the desk, the people at the desk, the people at the desk then bless you to be able to participate in this transaction." - Snowden at Web3 Summit 2019
