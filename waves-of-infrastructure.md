# Waves of Infrastructure
To contexualize the current state of internet platform infrastructure it is useful to understand the different stages and the process of verticality. IMHO, this is most obvious when we look at the distribution of music, due to its relativly small filesize and its general interest: Everybody listens to music, somehow.

### Wave One: P2P Filesharing (distributed)
> peer-to-peer software to exchange files
> bandwidth: upload / download asymmetry
> another problem: always-on, only available when other participants are only, synchronicity
> file management is completely in the hands of the users 

### Wave Two: Filesharing Services (decentralized)
decentralized services "solved" the problems / bypassed the downsides / made trade-offs, so that there only had to be a one-time upload from the user with its limited upload bandwidth and then the service would handle all the download traffic, often limiting the amounts of downloads or the speed of bandwidth with freemium business models to pay for the servers.
The browser was the only tool needed and download links could be shared easily.  
> file management is still in the hands of the user

### Wave Three: Streaming Services (centralized)
streaming services made filesharing almost unneccessary for mainstream music, "all in one place", easy to navigate, no individual payments for a song, easy to mange, personal playlists
> file management through platform 
also changes of industry through publishing on soundcloud
> artists want their music to be "free" and used to generate network effects to indirect earn money through other forms of products (events, premium content, etc.)

### Apple, Trust and the Music Industry
> filesystem abstraction, closed system
> but bootstrapped from p2p filesharing and ripping cds
> managing the music files in an application dependent system for specifc music hardware (ipod), then became general purpose (iphone) which inherits the same control mechanisms 
> closed system with syncing increased trust of the industry to prevent the possibilit of mobile device file-sharing
