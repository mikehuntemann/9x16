# Waves of Infrastructure
To contexualize the current state of internet platform infrastructure it is useful to understand the different stages and the process of verticality or centralization.

### Passive Web
The **Web 1.0** permitted people with the browser the ability to read.
It was content - mostly text and photos â€“ that was hosted by one person or group, open to the public. This was a one-dimentional relationship between the publisher and the reader, the same asymmetric relationship we have seen with newspapers, television and movies but now open to everyone that is able to setup their server, domain and website. 

### Interactive Web
**Web 2.0** added the capabilites of writing, the paradigm that is very present today. The twist in that is that you don't "own" any of the content you host on those platforms. For more conveniece, more adoption and therefore more people within that community that could eventually be exposed to your content. Platforms integrate the crucial parts of content discovery within a unified interface, that is for most people easily accessable. It started on the desktop but expanded extensively with the emergence of smartphones for real-time updates and an inclusive image production and broadcasting pipeline.

// private protocols: stable mediums to communicate within the network
// reputation, relevance & personalization

### Distributed Web
In the last few years a different movement started to grow again: the idea about linked data, the **Web 3.0**. This paradigm adds the capability of verifiablity (trust) to the reading and writing procedures, which I will explain in the last chapter "Rebalancing Verticality".

But to explain first why we had inevitiably experience this extreme form of platformization I want to sketch out the underlying mechanics and limitations of the infrastructure that powers the internet and where management and control is located and what trade-offs where made by the "users" over time.

IMHO, this process becomes most obvious when we look at the history and distribution of music, due to its relativly small filesize, cost and general interest, as well as the speed in which the music industry got disrupted by internet technologies.

### Wave One: P2P Filesharing (distributed)
> as part of the early web 2.0
> peer-to-peer software to exchange files
> bandwidth: upload / download asymmetry
> another problem: always-on, only available when other participants are only, synchronicity
> file management is completely in the hands of the users 


Back in the days, peer-to-peer filesharing had the missing incentive structure for offering the content on torrents which led to a marketplace on the basis of althruism, therefore paving the way for the "free-rider problem". This mixed togother with a limited upload capacity which was asymmetrical to the download as well as the regulatory framework that suppressed the usage by the narration of piracy ("You wouldn't steal a car!") and threats of potential legal action. 



### Wave Two: Filesharing Services (decentralized)
decentralized services "solved" the problems / bypassed the downsides / made trade-offs, so that there only had to be a one-time upload from the user with its limited upload bandwidth and then the service would handle all the download traffic, often limiting the amounts of downloads or the speed of bandwidth with freemium business models to pay for the servers.
The browser was the only tool needed and download links could be shared easily.  
> file management is still in the hands of the user


### Wave Three: Apple, Trust and the Music Industry (centralized)
> filesystem abstraction, closed system
> but bootstrapped from p2p filesharing and ripping cds
> managing the music files in an application dependent system for specifc music hardware (ipod), then became general purpose (iphone) which inherits the same control mechanisms 
> closed system with syncing increased trust of the industry to prevent the possibility of mobile device file-sharing


### Wave Four: Streaming Services & Platforms (vertical)
streaming services made filesharing almost unneccessary for mainstream music, "all in one place", easy to navigate, no individual payments for a song, easy to mange, personal playlists
> file management through platform 
also changes of industry through publishing on soundcloud
> artists want their music to be "free" and used to generate network effects to indirect earn money through other forms of products (events, premium content, etc.)
