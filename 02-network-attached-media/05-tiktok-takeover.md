## TikTok Takeover

TikTok is a weird creature. Before being merged together, **TikTok (2017)** was a 1:1 clone of **Musically (2014)** which was meant to perform and record lip-sync videos within the mobile device. It integrated music samples from their service which no other app was capable of at that time. The app took off with the "#dontjudgechallenge" which appeared 2015 as a reaction to the YouTube video ["You look disgusting"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWTRwj9t-vU) by "My Pale Skin", which then became viral on several social media sites. The three most used apps for this "challenge" were **Vine (2013)**, Flipagram and Musically itself. Vine could only solve the "mobile-only" image editing while only having  recorded audio from the phones microphone. Flipagram let you compose videos to the music library you had on your phone and Musically provided their music library to the user-base to which you could perform, making the selection of songs more available and frictionless.
Interestingly, the cross-platform challenge didn't had a "unified soundtrack", only the way the videos were timed and performed matched up.

After Musically solved the [initial problem](https://web.archive.org/web/20171107015536/https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-musically-2016-5?international=true&r=US&IR=T) of cropped videos – they were 9x16 natively, but the shared platforms were back then still focusing on the 1:1, square format, they repositioned their branding to the center after each clip – which got them to the top of the app stores shortly after.

A few years later, TikTok emerges in the western culture, giving the app a different spin. It included more advanced in-app editing capabilities, mostly a combination of video filters and augmented reality features. With that, the focus was not only the performance to music, but content that would "challenge" the user to (re-)produce a certain editing style and performance to a specific soundtrack. TikTok works as a Meme-Machine. And it works "better than language".

TikTok is not trying to be "meaningful", instead it is highly playful. An emotionally-driven, collective experience – on the smartphone.
What Twitter is for expressing and iterating thoughts in 280 characters, TikTok is for expressing and iterating on performances in short, 15 second timeframes.

With over [1.5B downloads](https://web.archive.org/web/20191116161829/https://www.cnet.com/news/tiktok-hits-1-5-billion-downloads-report-says/) today, TikTok reaches an international audience, mobilizing masses to contribute to ongoing challenges. In terms of the performance-based characteristics, TikTok seems as the "end-game" to what is the most engaging, most entertaining and easiest to (re-)produce app on the market today.

### Content Creation
An interesting shift can be seen within the app. Compared to Facebook and Instagram, were all the content is highly identity- or brand-based, TikTok makes the challenges itself to the epicenter. It is an event, a happening, trying to get you active and participate. (In this sense, it is maybe more related to Twitter than anything else.) With that, each of the content creators become the transport layer of an idea, which seem to create either a copy of existing patterns, an iteration upon existing content or a pattern breaking "anti-genre", which resists to conform and tries to disrupt the users expectation or "micro viewing habit" (for each challenge or "branch" of challenges).

This little moment of a surprising element plays with the expectations of previously seen footage within the challenge. This type of media creates the incentive for creating even funnier versions and alterations.

The musical rhythm becomes the recipe and driving force for the recording and editing process.
The memes are music-driven. It sets the mood and directs the pace. In my research, I found that this music can be identified as "plot twist" music, separating the 15 second soundtrack often into two phases: problem / solution, before / after or other "binary states" or sequences.

The underlying music supports this "plot twisting" even by their initial structure itself, for example by an uplifting build into a bass-drop or by further editing the music by heavily overused bass-amplifiers or other editing techniques. And sometimes a combination of multiple editing styles for even more extreme versions. Those kind of sounds are often user uploads, originating from Soundcloud or bass-boosted versions from YouTube. If that is the case, the users name is referenced as the "original uploader" of the soundtrack. In other cases, the platform-provided songs features the original musician and title at the bottom.

**General Evolutionary Patterns**
- genre / "genre-iteration" / anti-genre
- conform or copy / enhance or reimagine / fight
- expected / surprised / broken

**General Editing Patterns**
- one-take
- plot-twisting (binary states) directed by "drop"
- more complex sequences directed by rhythm

### Referencing System
As I already mentioned, the platform focuses on the users visual "re-action" or "react-ability", implementing features to easily react to other content in split-screen square format, or when performed in groups as a staircase formation of ever smaller 9x16 content. These formats become "chain reactions" of asynchronous-produced group performances to the same source.

But TikTok's internal media reactions tool is not the only feature that makes it so referential. All assets that are used (music and filters) are transparent and available in the interface, giving each user the same possibilities and tools of creation. This can be seen as an evolution and increased capability of the instagram filters which were encoded into the image as such, hiding its references, but changed with the way how they approach "Stories", where the input or tool is also mentioned within the interface.

// With this "openness", we can see "micro-creativity" at it's best. An atomized, "democratized" way of producing, bundled with a platform-specific referencing system that increases reproduction.


In my visual case-study "TikTok Takeover", I investigated the "#karmaisabitchchallenge" that got viral within the Chinese version of TikTok in early 2018, which then got cross-platform viral and internationally known after more and more people picked it up reacted to and reported on it. I mostly focused on the different timings and chain of events of the related assets and influences within the trend.

To describe the format at least briefly, each video starts with a short lip-sync sequence of "Oh well, karma is a bitch!" which is reenacted by the participants. This is the "inspirational quote" of the "iconic character" Veronica Lodge of the US TV series "Riverdale". These are the necessary ingredients for the so-called "Instagram Edits". The trend is not "born" within the TikTok community but adopted and repurposed by the TikTok community. "Instagram Edits" are made by a loyal fanbase which produces and publishes their videos within [#omgpage](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/omgpage/).

What we can see within that community is that they primarily build their videos around "badass characters" from the visual mainstream pop-culture. But furthermore and what is in my option remarkable, they exchange their video assets and snippets under specific referencing conditions. This way, Instagram becomes the publishing tool for the videos but at the same time the community management tool for peer-to-peer asset sharing and referencing. But back to the specific challenge!

Like I mentioned above, the challenges are based on a "binary state", the before and after. In this case the moment of surprise is in the "transformational shot", when the participants are first dressed "casually" or "ordinary" but then transform or reveal themselves in a "stylish", "glamorous", "cool" or "exotic" way by using an editing technique of cutting between the throw of a towel and a slow-motion effect.



Looking at the processes happening it TikTok can make you question the concept of "intellectual property" pretty fast. No-one "owns" the meme, it is the result of an organic, cultural process that creates multiple artifacts and patterns, which may only differ in popularity. The transmitted information has a live on its own. Virality in this context means: you become the temporary host and transport layer that extends the time and assures the survival of the idea itself.

Those emerging viral happenings are a temporary form of synchronization, or so-called ["micro-singularities"](https://web.archive.org/web/20190407203813/https://www.fastcompany.com/3047798/welcome-to-the-age-of-the-micro-singularity). They a rhythm-based, in repetitive production processes in relation to the content creators production and viewing habits. So what is the purpose? The survival of the information itself, the idea, the pattern, and through that the network in which it appears, grows and spreads. The meme can act as the fuel and amplifier of user-generated content. Its creation is decentralized in its nature and therefore hard to control.

These creations are appreciated, supported and guided by the engagement- and performance-based AI systems, which don't control the creation itself but what gets seen and consequently gets replicated for content that seems to be "performative" enough.

TikTok (as well as any other AI-driven social media platform) monitors and responds to the unfolding creations, mutations and interactions, managing the ["content lifecycle"](https://web.archive.org/web/20180722215334/http://www.bytedance.com/ai/). Interestingly, this also implies the cycling, repetitive nature of patterns within the content.

AI system can sense what resonates the most with our limbic system. We do it unconsciously, without being able to describe why it "kicks" us. Bundled with the functions of the meme, which also has a “psychological appeal” to us. This is probably now the fundamental problem of "information asymmetry", were technology becomes "more conscious" of behavior patterns than the users within the system.

> "[Memes] force us to react to them by trying to perfect an even better generation of armaments, thus assuring their own replication and survival. And in doing so they exact a price from those who let their minds be colonized by them, a price reckoned in psychic energy, labor, resources, and money." – The Evolving Self (1993), Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Memes vs Genes, p. 126

Memes need "a fertile medium of growth" but also symbiotic relationship with the host, which is a necessary in the beginning, otherwise we would not integrate them. This relates for "mimetic media" itself but also for technology and knowledge creation in general. Both sides need to have an aligned goal or "transactional" relationship, a win-win situation.

With this organic replication, we see a loss of centralized "artistic control". Production becomes decentralized and therefore unpredictable.
The produced content for brands and their marketing strategy were previously managed by the art director. But now, what appears more and more is that marketing wants to be organic, meme-based, user-generated, viral. This can be seen as an iteration of the very effective word-of-mouth advertising from the people you trust in you social circles.

Nevertheless, this network will and inevitably has to integrate advertising and initiate "commercialized challenges" or other forms of "paid or enforced virality" because this service is also stuck in the ad-business model paradigm.

In the end, I want to focus on the technologies that come together in this analysis of this mobile-first meme-based platform.
In general personal habit and the enhanced user experience of the devices aim to the same thing: reduce the cognitive load to a minimum to operate. In the constellation how TikTok implements their network specific functions, the challenges and the resulting memes also need as little thought as possible to be able to at least imitate the content. This makes it accessible to the masses.  

So what are all the ingredients at play? For this I sketched out an equation to be able to frame TikTok as ultimate tool for "vertical media" and my conclusion that this is the "end-game":

```
Vertical Media = (Mobile Device + Video + UI/UX) x Scale of Network x AI**  
or more specifically:  
**Flow as Lock-in Mechanism = (Always On + Image Flow + Flow of Interaction or Workflow) x Maximum Possible Reach x Amplification
```

And with these flows of constantly appearing "mirco-viralities", these rhythms and impulses for creation become the heartbeat of the network and they keep each other alive.

so what does this all mean for "new media"?

if we can look what might remain valuable in the future, we can escape the "nowness" of these platforms and aim for a bigger purpose or goal.
