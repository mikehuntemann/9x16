## Legacy Desktop Platforms

### Dominant Newsfeeds (General Purpose, Accumulators)
"silent media" > text, photo, gif, hyperlink

#### Facebook as Social Base-layer

> “We want to build a system which is as deeply as possible integrated into every major device and things that people want to use.” - Zuckerberg (YCombinator, Sep, 2012)

platform of scale, general purpose network, "inclusive" to all sorts of content
Facebook starts as a social network which scaled exponentially with the help of its mobile and platform strategy.
Experimental devices with deep facebook integrations came to market but failed.
facebooks biggest mistake: not being native
The html5 (wrapper) strategy came to an end in 2011 when they realized, that the way to go forward is native.
Since then facebook is a mobile-first company.
buying networks: Instagram + WhatsApp
(WhatsApp had 450 million monthly active users and 315 million daily active users on IPO)
That are a lot of unique phone numbers.


#### Inclusion: External Image Production Tools

vc funding, competitors, apps that integrate / build bridges

Many apps were focusing on cross-platform social media content production and sharing (via facebook connect, etc.) which manifested itself in the production of square-format media formats, starting with images first and expanding their capabilities to video later. Instagram with its tight integration of facebooks social graph it was easy to sign in and also very easy to share back to facebook. Vine, which was structurally a clone of instagram, focused on short 6-second video loops. This triggered instagram to adapt to the new video format and the square video format was a few months later available for their user base.
The keyword here is timeline or newsfeed share ability. Images that have to integrate and live within the structures of these “content management systems”(?) / containers / stable formats / medium.



### Dominant Video Hoster: Youtube

#### YouTube as Default for iOS

- easy integration due to device rotation
- easy to consume but not good enough for production
