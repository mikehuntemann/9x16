## What does the network want?

> “First there are more users [on mobile devices], right, obviously. The second is that per person who is using Facebook on mobile there is more engagement and they are spending more time. And third is that per amount of time people spend on mobile we think we can make a lot more money than we do on desktop, too.” – [Mark Zuckerberg (TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2012)](https://youtu.be/o2wPzjH2xwA?t=141)


Currently, the internet has fundamental problem: monetization. Most social media platforms that survived the initial start-up and venture capital phase have an ad-centric business model or were merged into one. The initial narration is always: create an app, scale the community, become a platform and then introduce ads to generate revenue and support (full-time) content creators to continue and let them create a business on top of your platform.

The resulting problem is that the ad business model is tightly connected to the "time-on-site" metric. The more time you spend on the platform and become dependent upon it, the more ads you will see, the more money will be generated in the background.
But this gives the network a "perverse incentive" that can cause unintentional consequences.

But in terms of the business model and "user-engagement" I think the companies see it as a natural fit or process of merging marketing metrics, brand affiliations and content production, so I would say it is intentional. And why wouldn't they? They are just "sensing" what the creators and the users want and iterate upon that. They are just amplifying the signals the users give respond back to them. This is what Chamath Palihapitiya calls ["not a Facebook problem"](https://youtu.be/hZY986XSHxM?t=111) but a consumer problem, because users ["have grown addicted to things that are free (...) it's just no expectation [to pay for things on the internet]."

Ultimately, this fundamental framework leads to habituation or in its extreme form to addiction, as Natasha Dow Schull illustrates perfectly in her book and same-titled talk ["Addiction by Design"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak0HE8Y_UJY) at the "Habit Summit 2014".

By recurring visits to the platform and to certain creators that integrate the companies (and therefore the algorithms) incentives into their media production, which reinforces the "expectations" of the distribution system and therefore the expectation of the audience.

With this focus on engagement came the emergence of the "social video" or "community-driven videos", as Facebook calls it.

> "We are trying to imagine ways to make the experience of watching a video on Facebook inextricable from the experience of sharing or discussing it." – [Daniel Danker (Product Management Director, Facebook)](https://youtu.be/RPqVq9A4o_4?t=1829)

Here it is useful to note that Facebook still separates the audience from the content creator. This paradigm blurs with the concept of TikTok, but I will get into that in the next chapter.

With Live Video as an example for maximum platform engagement, it sets the bar for seamless integration of interaction within a broadcast, resulting in streams of public comments or private chatting with friends (you can also invite) and discuss further in Messenger.

What Facebook is creating are more platform dependencies, incentivizing and funneling reactions, responses and discussions back into their vertical communication system.

Facebook wants to integrate everything, therefore content has to be Facebook specific because "native always wins" in terms of control, efficiency and user experience. An interesting example here is the tweaking of Facebooks News Feed algorithm that resulted in a step-by-step reduction of shared and displayed YouTube videos within the feed. YouTube videos show up half as much as native Facebook videos. Not only this, but in addition to that the YouTube video has a "less preferential" and optimized News Feed integration: "non-native" content gets smaller previews and misses autoplay functions, which in side-by-side comparison creates more friction in the process of playing the video, or in terms of metrics: "time-to-play" gets extended dramatically.

> "Ultimately, our goal is to make the video experience on Facebook more social and to build more intention and habit around video"
what does it mean for publishers and creators with Facebook audiences?
community will be the core of video that it affects the content in itself. new content formats and best practices are emerging in this world of community-driven video." – [Daniel Danker (Product Management Director, Facebook)](https://youtu.be/RPqVq9A4o_4?t=1829)

//                                    ^ check timecode and source

Based on their internal metrics, Facebook senses that "communal watching" amplifies the experience of watching video content, shared videos from friends are watched 40% longer, live videos together with friends result in longer watch times and have in general up to 6x the engagement.

So to paraphrase what Facebook is telling me: you watch videos on those platforms because your friends have watched it, you watch them longer because you can watch it with your friends, and in the end you chat more about it, because you want to talk with your friends about what you are watching, anyway.

As a partial conclusion, or for time efficiency reasons, you probably shouldn't have friends on social media platforms. Or as Wendy Chun stated: "(...) online friends are an extremely leaky technology."
This is not only true for the leakage of "data" but of "time".
// ^ check for reference

So how different is YouTube without having a "network of friends" attached? Two years earlier, YouTube released "The 10 Youtube Fundamentals" as a set of guidelines, what content "works" on their platform. Let me paraphrase again:

A YouTube video does not want to be a one-hit-wonder. YouTube wants them to be repetitive, continuous and branded (recognizable, identifiable, familiar). They want them to be concise in length but also in time to understand, so it favors the easy idea.
Through the network comes interactivity, which leads to a faster feedback loop (producer > community > producer) and a change in language. Direct communication is the ideal form of narration. Speaking directly into the camera, and therefore to the audience. You are also speaking to a specific community, a group of people with a collective interest in something, so be sure that you create content that specifically targets this audience. Your audience wants to see you in a predictable and for you sustainable timeframe, so make sure that you lower your production value to a minimum. To attract new viewers you can always talk about popular topics ("evergreens") or create content with a sense of usefulness ("how-to's").
Another way to a bigger audience is to make collaborations with already popular content creators which share a mutual, community-based interest.

Or to put it differently, this is not the place for your one-time media art video experiments.

While Youtube is a place to host any kind of video content, the tendencies of the network lead to a specific formation of the video content itself (genres, production) and its channel (timeframe). The sequence of uploaded videos becomes the tool of community creation and management (subscribers), which is connected to Youtube as the platform and not to the creator in the first place. A cross-platform community is therefore only possible with additional work and reinforcement. The audience of the channel builds their loyalty and their viewing habits to the platform first and the creator second, due to the multiplicity and therefore replaceability of content creators around the world.

Changing algorithms for content discovery on the homepage and the trending section were problematic for content creators in the past, who experienced massive drops in their views.
On October 8, 2019 YouTube [leaked several metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KUJVhgHUXk) of their system, revealing the "P-Score" (Preference Score) which measures and filters every video on the platform for the most engaging and brand-appropriate content to put advertising in front of it. One of the internal indicator was "throttling" which limits the videos distribution and its amount of possible ads and therefore limit the income of the creator because of advertising "unfriendliness", to protect the actual business partners of YouTube / Google.

And also unexpected UI/UX changes interfere with the accessibility of  video content. Platform changes are made by the company and often poorly communicated beforehand. There is no voice from the user-base, neither from the content creators nor the audience.

What I also experienced in my own practice when working with genre specific research YouTube: when I want to use YouTube as an archive, they don't really let me do it. More accurately, YouTube doesn’t want to be an archive. It hides its history in the interface. In my case, I had to use a workaround with the google video search. Only there I was able to filter the content for example by specific dates.

To just quickly summarize: you can almost upload anything to their database, but their provided (visual) interface is always the bottleneck of access from the outside, paired with functional restrictions and the "spacial scarcity" of the vertical list of pre-sorted content. But this a general problem of "findability" and "discovery" and not specific to YouTube. This is a "curation problem", scarce screen space meets scarce time meets abundant content.

So back to Facebook:
As we could see, the basic mechanisms stay the same and are not "friend-dependent". This is just the dynamic with between producers of web videos and "their" communities, in which YouTube seems to be more passive or conservative with the functionalities of audience to channel communication, because the conversations or comments are always related to this one video and not generalized, like Facebook is providing with Groups.   

> "The key is always: start with great content. Number one is actually know your audience and use your insights to understand which content is resonating and (...) we are clearly rewarding content that brings people back, which creates this loyalty. (...) And then it's really about nurturing it and for that I would say that Live remains as the best tool we have (...) and then we are seeing that Groups is actually a way to extent your presence as a creator beyond the times were you are actually directly engaging because the fans make the stories for you."
– [Fidji Simo (Vice President of Product, Facebook)](https://youtu.be/fb6QfpIsXJc?t=876)


The video content only seems to act as a catalyst for engagement – a trigger – which is creating a platform lock-in, everything is only happening in this one place. But why do we have to have the discussions within Facebook? I think the audience doesn't really care so much about that. But Facebook does: your behavior and reactions can be measured, quantified and you don't get interrupted by other stuff that isn't on Facebook (e.g. the real world, life in general or Facebook competitors).

But what happens when distribution systems of those platforms change?
As I already mentioned with the case of YouTube, these changes happen frequently and unexpected.
Facebook especially is a perfect example of what this means for the people on the platform: they are consistently reducing the amount of people you can reach "natively" within your Facebook Pages community. This limit of communication is called "organic reach" and it is declining from year-to-year, effectively incentivizing brands to use "paid reach" to keep the communication to your potential customers alive. Here it becomes clear, that you don't "own" your community, even though you might see how many followers you have. This is not peer-to-peer, the connection is not guaranteed when you have to use facebook as a proxy or have to have it as a gatekeeper to the community.

But this mechanism is exactly the same as we have seen in the "file-sharing approaches" chapter. "organic reach" acts in this case as the  bandwidth limitation we saw with the file-hosting services that offered a "freemium" business model: free and limited communications with the server or paid, premium access with certain privileged. Pay-to-win!

Another example I want to bring up is the so-called "pivot to video".

In 2015, Facebook incentivized producers and creators to "pivot to video" just by tweaking the algorithm to distribute this format more prominently and therefore suppressed previous forms and formats as for example written content.

> "With the launch of auto-play and the surge in mobile use, it’s also important to focus on posting videos that grab people from the first frame of video. Shorter, timely video content tends to do well in News Feed. Keep in mind that auto-play videos play silently in News Feed until someone taps to hear sound, so videos that catch people’s attention even without sound often find success."
– ["What the Shift to Video Means for Creators" (Facebook for Media Blog)](https://web.archive.org/web/20191106024036/https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/what-the-shift-to-video-means-for-creators)

This led to a series of job-cuts within the media landscape because of the prioritization of short video content over written ones. In the aftermath of that, Facebook had to face a lawsuit because of "inaccurate" viewership numbers for their advertisers.

Remarkably, three years later and after facing again a lot of pressure, Facebook changes the algorithm again: with a "pivot to meaningful"!

> "One of our big focus areas for 2018 is making sure the time we all spend on Facebook is time well spent. (...) But too often today, watching video, reading news or getting a page update is just a passive experience." - [Mark Zuckerberg](https://web.archive.org/web/20191005033943/https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571)



> "With this update, we will also prioritize posts that spark conversations and meaningful interactions between people. To do this, we will predict which posts you might want to interact with your friends about, and show these posts higher in feed. These are posts that inspire back-and-forth discussion in the comments and posts that you might want to share and react to – whether that’s a post from a friend seeking advice, a friend asking for recommendations for a trip, or a news article or video prompting lots of discussion."
– ["Bringing People Closer Together" (Facebook Newsroom)](https://web.archive.org/web/20191030231904/https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/)

Passive behavior on the platform is now something negative. You have to be active and engaged! This change de-emphasizes the short videos again, but now promoting videos with higher production value and meaningful content from your friends.
This is also a fighting against "viral videos" that would bring them [more watch-time in the short-term but not in the long-term](https://youtu.be/Boj9eD0Wug8?t=4263).

> "(...) we fundamentally believe that video doesn't have to be a passive experience. In fact, we think that video is becoming way more engaging in the years to come as many formats of content can be reinvented for an experience where the audience can participate with the content."

and this leads me to the thesis that we would be better off if facebooks communication formats would actually be protocols itself instead of an ever changing, closed and private tool for communication.


### Pivot to Video
I

when videos are getting performance-based, the produces get feedback on their "fitness". this heavily relies on the algorithmic distribution system that filters the content.

youtube example, in-transparent indicators > should prevent "gaming the system" > can be updated anytime > not stable, unpredictable

what could go wrong? > "Russian interference", Cambridge Analytica
not a bug, it's a feature: targeting and persuasion, just marketing!

Facebook algorithm changes > "pivot to video" (2015), media companies cutting staff for written content, because short-form video "works better"
in addition to that, the metric for "views" itself was flawed. after an update, playbacks under 3 seconds weren't counted as views, leading to 60-80% drops in view-related metrics.

3 sec (Facebook) vs 30 sec (YouTube) as a measurement of one view.

The proposed model of  
**Machine Distance**  
Research > Developer > Admin > Power-User > End-User  
transforms into:  
**Power / Control Layers**  
Platform (Network) > Developers / Distribution Algorithm > Production and Community Management Tools > Content Creator > Consumer / Audience


### Pivot to Meaningful

paddle back, de-emphasizing videos again, promoting videos with higher production value
- fighting viral videos, instead "meaningful, high quality engagement"

> "With this update, we will also prioritize posts that spark conversations and meaningful interactions between people.

These are posts that inspire back-and-forth discussion in the comments and posts that you might want to share and react to – whether that’s a post from a friend seeking advice, a friend asking for recommendations for a trip, or a news article or video prompting lots of discussion."

youtube suppresses the recommendation content that is not suited to be used for ad rolls.
youtube score also rates your "production value"

instagram closes api to keep users within the platform, instagram has the highest engagement rates of every social media platform
instagram copies stories feature to stop snapchat growth, it is just a feature so it can be copied but the different culture on snapchat can't be copied.


aggregator news feeds don't work with video: they are silent and mute sound on playback. this itself shapes the content, resulting in more and more subtitled videos. The context always forms the visual. This is how the invisible shapes the visible.

live video (fb) results in 6x engagement


what gets seen, gets replicated or distributed (amplification)



Buzzfeed, pivot to viral, platform native content vs buzzfeed.com

the social video

the future of video on facebook

newsfeed is for discovery "just browsing", it is passive and unintentional
"community-driven video"
"shows that give us something to talk about"
"videos are a shared experience" > tv shows



videos build around a group of common interest > fanbase of HBO series

IGTV as a result for creator feedback that the 15 sec cap is a problem
problem of cross-platform community building > you can not transfer your views to another platform so you need tools within the platform

different communities on different platforms
IGTV + facebook watch to cross-post to both platforms to monetize
IGTV is bootstrapped from facebooks watch platform (only 6 month development time) they could just plug-in

a minute for video in feeds is "long", because feed is for discovery
IGTV app is intentional long-format

facebook watch is focusing on habitual viewing experience that brings you back and creating this loyalty with the content creators, pages get favored if they have the property of bringing people back to the platform


big audience = revenue share of ad breaks
niche audience = direct funding from "super fans"
branded content = platform to get brand and creators connected via target audience and "mutual interest"


once the network is established, you want to increase the flow within it. workflow, but also direct the flow in favor of the company.


creator monetization is linked to "network compliance"
threat of de-platformization
subscriptions like Patreon separate payments from videos, network performance weights less (but is a "niche").  


And within the research I still see the need for tools like facebook, but not from facebook or on facebook. But the same is true for twitter and others.

All content will somehow be business-facing, with the creation of an business to influencer platform. As a service for businesses, targeting specific audiences. (as the old paradigm of "artistic control")

Facebook became, after a long period of time, an enhanced, socialized and production-wise verticalized version of youtube, with the same business model and the same principles for content creation as a means of community management. In parallel to that, Netflix is also doing the same, but they risk-manage their own productions by predictions through their feedback-loop with the otherwise passive audience.  

All content is measured against the underlying social graph (or relational databases), the heart and engine of Facebook (or each other platform), that makes this targeting and measurements possible in the first place.

so how do networks behave that don't have Facebooks' social graph at its core?

So what makes TikTok so different from the pre-existing networks?

















### Permanence, Availability & Censorship


### context, environment, expectations

### Flow-Opimization: Data, Perception, Production
How Flow and Habit are liked:

When social media networks extend their capabilities to video, this is an expensive tradeoff in the first place (processing power and bandwidth, storage maybe not so much). So was is the motivation behind it? What metrics make it a good investment for the company? This again, goes back to the engagement rates of the content:

- "flow" through scrolling photos vs the "flow" of viewing media content within the flow of scrolling
- fighting the meme / viral video > meaningful interaction vs reinforcing engagement
- viral videos increasing time on site
- Zuckerberg on adjusting video content, 1:11:00
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boj9eD0Wug8&feature=youtu.be
- video is not skim-able, you have to watch it for longer than a post or a picture, videos resonate more with our limbic system, less abstracted, more personal, more bandwidth, implicit information: body language, voice

Short video formats are going to die or will survive through iterative alterations or memification ("participation" culture).

- fluidity as a medium (apple)



time-preferences, survival, longevity > relevance
value in the body of work, archive is the store of value , not the content itself > habituation and ephemeral content, addiction, crisis
flow-optimization == engagement

the only way to express yourself is within the content itself while competing with other creators against limited attention spans.


"we live in public"
