### iPhone

With the emergence of the iPhone and its App Store users and developers have the ability to extend the capabilities of the device and sell products directly to the end consumer.
While there was a lot of potential for developers to make money with apps, most social media focused apps came for free, expecting to make money in the future with a growing user base.

In 2011, Apple introduced its first System-on-a-Chip (SoC) the Apple A4 which was used in the iPad and the iPhone 4. The increases in processing power while maintaining very efficient allowed the use cases for HD video and image processing. In combination with good camera quality, the iPhone 4 was presented as an all-in-one (vertical) solution for media production.

### The Vertical Picture (2011)

resistance and disintegration: snapchat

Snapchat was started as a counter-reaction to the “social competition” inside newsfeeds and provided an image-based chat design with ephemeral content that would disappear after you have seen the image.
This fundamentally different perspective, which was not based on the newsfeed centric communication, but a fullscreen, close-friend, image-based messenger.

### Vertical Media / Viral Media

The instant, in-the-moment or real-time nature of these services are a result of the mobility of the smartphone as main driver. This consequently led to the fragmentation or segmentation of media content, to integrate perfectly into the everyday life and the short timeframes of boredom that want to be eradicated. Smaller content increases the feedback loops until everything becomes an endless process, a continuous conversation.

Vertical media is a result of a data- and performance-driven, AI curated, engagement focused environment. This way, the preferences of the network actively incentives "prosumers" / users to a specific mode of production.  

The commodification of time and attention.

The metrics of success have changed. For movies it was the box office, the revenue it would generate after release. Today, success is a matter of community growth rates.

Vertical media is deeply centralized because of the "hosting problem" and network effects.

All media wants - sooner or later - to gain from network effects, everyone wants their work the be seen and their voice to be heard.
> "marketing" ideas, machine distance gap

 Owning the attention (within and through these communication channels) is the new version of property rights.

Verticality as a mean of institutional self-preservation, at its core it is just survival.

"(Mobile Device + Video + UI/UX) x Network Size x AI = Vertical Media"  

"(Always On + Image Flow + Interaction Flow) x Reach x Amplification / Modulation = Flow as Lock-in Mechanism / Prison for the Mind"







### VC Funding

Pump and dump = another platform that is going to take off potentially = VC funding
Therefore the narrative of products that might transition into a profitable business in the future.
This led to flipping and merging little apps / companies into the bigger ones.
The narrative will change if this market cycle ends and will lead to profitability focused business models.
This cycle coincides with the emerging digital economies of crypto-currencies and digital tokens, which will inevitably change the fundamental characteristics and "freeness" of the internet.
vs Ad-based business models are the only way to make money on the internet.


### Going Vertical / Becoming an Ecosystem / Platform Economies
You create a product which establishes a network and then you iterate the increase bandwidth within the network to increase the value of each component and participant within it.

“Value is psychological; price is determined by the market.”
Early Retirement Extreme / Economic p.212

If something like Bitcoin is described as a monetary store of value, then Facebook is the store of non-monetary, social value which leverages the scarce asset of attention and the abundant asset of storage and therefore history, where all the long-term value comes from.
(ultra short term, ephemeral, habit > long-term only when archivable)

### Memes
> downloads/flow-collection/the-evolving-self-1993

facebook as a meme? more powerful version through bigger network

the meme does not help the creator with survival, only its own survival.
you are only the transmission layer, you perform an idea, it is about the idea - its iterations - and not about you.
"(...) a meme is any permanent pattern of matter or information produced by an act of human intentionality. (...)
Memes come into being when the human nervous system reacts to an experience, and codes it in a form that can be communicated to others." p.120

"Memes require only our minds to feed on, and they will replicate images of themselves in consciousness. A catchy tune I hear on the radio may colonize my mind for several days, surviving there thanks to the psychic energy I devote to it."
p.122

"mimetic alleles"

"Let us remember that enhancing survival, in evolutionary terms, means increasing the number of one's own offspring relative to that of other members of one's group." > memes don't do that

"memes force us to react to them by trying to perfect an even better generation of armaments, thus assuring their own replication and survival. And in doing so they exact a price from those who let their minds be colonized by them, a price reckoned in psychic energy, labor, resources, and money. In this sense weapons clearly form to the definition of a parasitic species." p.126

> "a fertile medium of growth" human brain and the network



> "At first, all such relationships between human host and parasitic meme must be symbiotic: The host reproduces the drug because he enjoys it. And he believes that it is he who chooses the drug, and therefore it is he who is in control. Only later does the true nature of the relationship become clear: the human is no more in control of the drug than the trees are in control of the humans whose existence the trees made possible in the first place." p.128

new innovations become demanding and people lose control over it, they started this thing, others will iterate upon once the ideas is outside.
– the loss of "artistic control", DRM

> "Every product of technology takes up space in the mind, and requires some investment of attention that could have been used for some other purpose. Therefore it is vital to make sure that memes are truly symbiotic - that they contribute to our well-being, rather than become parasitic." p. 128

be cautious about habits, what you want let in, what you participate in  
> "The things you own end up owning you. But do what you like, man." - Tyler Durden

Facebook was fun, at first. Instagram was fun, at first. Snapchat was fun, at first. TikTok is fun, you know how this might go on..

### The Selfish Gene: Meme Chapter

The Selfish Gene Explained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9p2F2oa0_k

“Genes are immortal in the sense that the coded information they contain is reproduced, is replicated significantly. [Throughout multiple generations] that there are genes which are identical to what they were tens of millions of years ago. Not the DNA, of course that’s not that turns over in a very short space of time but the coded information is potentially immortal. (…) The genes who are good at building bodies, good at controlling processes of embryology to make bodies that have what it takes to preserve those genes and pass them on. A body is a survival machine and that is by far the most powerful way of interpreting what an individual organism is.     



“Cultural transmission is analogous to genetic transmission in that, although basically conservative, it can give rise to a form of evolution.”

“By comparing the songs of fathers and sons, Jenkins showed that song patterns were not inherited genetically. Each young male was likely to adopt songs from his territorial neighbours by imitation, in an analogous way to human language. (…) But occasionally Jenkins was privileged to witness the 'invention' of a new song, which occurred by a mistake in the imitation of an old one.”
“Jenkins refers to the origins of new songs as 'cultural mutations’.”

“[Cultural production] all evolve in historical time in a way that looks like highly speeded up genetic evolution, but has really nothing to do with genetic evolution.”


“a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. 'Mimeme' comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like 'gene'. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme.”
p.192

“When you plant a fertile meme in my mind you literally parasitize my brain, turning it into a vehicle for the meme's propagation in just the way that a virus may parasitize the genetic mechanism of a host cell.”

The meme has a “psychological appeal” > “resonates” with our mind

“Whenever conditions arise in which a new kind of replicator can make copies of itself, the new replicators mill lend to take over, and start a new kind of evolution of their own.”
“Imitation, in the broad sense, is how memes can replicate.“

“If the meme is a scientific idea, its spread will depend on how acceptable it is to the population of individual scientists; a rough measure of its survival value could be obtained by counting the number of times it is referred to in successive years in scientific journals.”

“Some memes, like some genes, achieve brilliant short-term success in spreading rapidly, but do not last long in the meme pool.”

Every time a scientist hears an idea and passes it on to somebody else, he is likely to change it somewhat.  (…) Yet I have not repeated them in his own words. I have twisted them round for my own purposes, changing the emphasis, blending them with ideas of my own and of other people.
(…) It looks as though meme trans- mission is subject to continuous mutation, and also to blending.

“I have said a tune is one meme, but what about a symphony: how many memes is that? Is each movement one meme, each recognizable phrase of melody, each bar, each chord, or what? (…)
There I divided the 'gene complex' into large and small genetic units, and units within units.”

“The computers in which memes live are human brains.“
“The human brain, and the body that it controls, cannot do more than one or a few things at once. If a meme is to dominate the attention of a human brain, it must do so at the expense of 'rival' memes. Other commodities for which memes compete are radio and television time, billboard space, newspaper column-inches, and library shelf-space.”

“We should not seek immortality in reproduction.
But if you contribute to the world's culture, if you have a good idea, compose a tune, invent a sparking plug, write a poem, it may live on, intact, long after your genes have dissolved in the common pool.”

“What we have not previously considered is that a cultural trait may have evolved in the way that it has, simply because it is advantageous to itself.”

“All that is necessary is that the brain should be capable of imitation: memes will then evolve that exploit the capability to the full.”

 “The point I am making now is that, even if we look on the dark side and assume that individual man is fundamentally selfish, our conscious foresight—our capacity to simulate the future in imagination—could save us from the worst selfish excesses of the blind replicators.”

“We have the power to defy the selfish genes of our birth and, if necessary, the selfish memes of our indoctrination.”

“We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.”



## Legacy Desktop Platforms

## Legacy Desktop Platforms

### Dominant Newsfeeds (General Purpose, Accumulators)
"silent media" > text, photo, gif, hyperlink

#### Facebook as Social Base-layer

> “We want to build a system which is as deeply as possible integrated into every major device and things that people want to use.” - Zuckerberg (YCombinator, Sep, 2012)

platform of scale, general purpose network, "inclusive" to all sorts of content
Facebook starts as a social network which scaled exponentially with the help of its mobile and platform strategy.
Experimental devices with deep facebook integrations came to market but failed.
facebooks biggest mistake: not being native
The html5 (wrapper) strategy came to an end in 2011 when they realized, that the way to go forward is native.
Since then facebook is a mobile-first company.
buying networks: Instagram + WhatsApp
(WhatsApp had 450 million monthly active users and 315 million daily active users on IPO)
That are a lot of unique phone numbers.


#### Inclusion: External Image Production Tools

vc funding, competitors, apps that integrate / build bridges

Many apps were focusing on cross-platform social media content production and sharing (via facebook connect, etc.) which manifested itself in the production of square-format media formats, starting with images first and expanding their capabilities to video later. Instagram with its tight integration of facebooks social graph it was easy to sign in and also very easy to share back to facebook. Vine, which was structurally a clone of instagram, focused on short 6-second video loops. This triggered instagram to adapt to the new video format and the square video format was a few months later available for their user base.
The keyword here is timeline or newsfeed share ability. Images that have to integrate and live within the structures of these “content management systems”(?) / containers / stable formats / medium.



### Dominant Video Hoster: Youtube

#### YouTube as Default for iOS

- easy integration due to device rotation
- easy to consume but not good enough for production


## initial stable medium

## The Initial Stable Medium (Specific) (?)
// Delete chapter? I think i missed the point of what is really stable here.. it is not the format, it is the network.

- Facebook: "Profile" Page
- Twitter: "Tweet", 140 char text
- Instagram: Square Photo
- Snapchat: Vertical Photo
- WhatsApp: Chat
- Musically: Vertical Video + Sound
- TikTok: Vertical Video + Sound
- Vine: Square Video
- YouTube: 4:3 Video + Thumbnail
- Reddit: Subreddit (?)
- Flicker: Photos (3:2) (?)
- Google: Sorted List
- Meerkat: Vertical Live Video (?)
- Periscope: Vertical Live Video (?)
- Flipagram: Square Video + Sound



## image production Cycles

So when everyone seems to be incentivized to create, what is "news" and what is really ”news-worthy"? Ironically, only time will tell, and this effect is called the "Lindy".

> "If a book has been in print for forty years, I can expect it to be in print for another forty years. But, and that is the main difference, if it survives another decade, then it will be expected to be in print another fifty years. This, simply, as a rule, tells you why things that have been around for a long time are not "aging" like persons, but "aging" in reverse. Every year that passes without extinction doubles the additional life expectancy." – Nassim Taleb (Antifragile)

> "So things that have been in existence for a long period of time can be considered more robust/antifragile, i.e., more likely to continue to survive, than new things that haven't passed the test of time"

> "complexity science" as "the study of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects"



## what does the network want?



and this leads me to the thesis that we would be better off if facebooks communication formats would actually be protocols itself instead of an ever changing, closed and private tool for communication.


### Pivot to Video
I

when videos are getting performance-based, the produces get feedback on their "fitness". this heavily relies on the algorithmic distribution system that filters the content.

youtube example, in-transparent indicators > should prevent "gaming the system" > can be updated anytime > not stable, unpredictable

what could go wrong? > "Russian interference", Cambridge Analytica
not a bug, it's a feature: targeting and persuasion, just marketing!

Facebook algorithm changes > "pivot to video" (2015), media companies cutting staff for written content, because short-form video "works better"
in addition to that, the metric for "views" itself was flawed. after an update, playbacks under 3 seconds weren't counted as views, leading to 60-80% drops in view-related metrics.

3 sec (Facebook) vs 30 sec (YouTube) as a measurement of one view.

The proposed model of  
**Machine Distance**  
Research > Developer > Admin > Power-User > End-User  
transforms into:  
**Power / Control Layers**  
Platform (Network) > Developers / Distribution Algorithm > Production and Community Management Tools > Content Creator > Consumer / Audience


### Pivot to Meaningful

> "One of our big focus areas for 2018 is making sure the time we all spend on Facebook is time well spent." - [Mark Zuckerberg](https://web.archive.org/web/20191005033943/https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571)


paddle back, de-emphasizing videos again, promoting videos with higher production value
- fighting viral videos, instead "meaningful, high quality engagement"

> "With this update, we will also prioritize posts that spark conversations and meaningful interactions between people. To do this, we will predict which posts you might want to interact with your friends about, and show these posts higher in feed. These are posts that inspire back-and-forth discussion in the comments and posts that you might want to share and react to – whether that’s a post from a friend seeking advice, a friend asking for recommendations for a trip, or a news article or video prompting lots of discussion."
– ["Bringing People Closer Together" (Facebook Newsroom)](https://web.archive.org/web/20191030231904/https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/)




youtube suppresses the recommendation content that is not suited to be used for ad rolls.
youtube score also rates your "production value"

instagram closes api to keep users within the platform, instagram has the highest engagement rates of every social media platform
instagram copies stories feature to stop snapchat growth, it is just a feature so it can be copied but the different culture on snapchat can't be copied.


aggregator news feeds don't work with video: they are silent and mute sound on playback. this itself shapes the content, resulting in more and more subtitled videos. The context always forms the visual. This is how the invisible shapes the visible.

live video (fb) results in 6x engagement


what gets seen, gets replicated or distributed (amplification)



Buzzfeed, pivot to viral, platform native content vs buzzfeed.com

the social video

https://developers.facebook.com/videos/f8-2017/the-future-of-video-on-facebook/
the future of video on facebook

newsfeed is for discovery "just browsing", it is passive and unintentional
"community-driven video"
"shows that give us something to talk about"
"videos are a shared experience" > tv shows



videos build around a group of common interest > fanbase of HBO series




https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb6QfpIsXJc

> "(...) we fundamentally believe that video doesn't have to be a passive experience. In fact, we think that video is becoming way more engaging in the years to come as many formats of content can be reinvented for an experience where the audience can participate with the content."
– [Fidji Simo (Vice President of Product, Facebook)](https://youtu.be/fb6QfpIsXJc?t=142)

creating polling, challenges, etc as interactive tools / products


IGTV as a result for creator feedback that the 15 sec cap is a problem
problem of cross-platform community building > you can not transfer your views to another platform so you need tools within the platform

different communities on different platforms
IGTV + facebook watch to cross-post to both platforms to monetize
IGTV is bootstrapped from facebooks watch platform (only 6 month development time) they could just plug-in

a minute for video in feeds is "long", because feed is for discovery
IGTV app is intentional long-format

facebook watch is focusing on habitual viewing experience that brings you back and creating this loyalty with the content creators, pages get favored if they have the property of bringing people back to the platform


big audience = revenue share of ad breaks
niche audience = direct funding from "super fans"
branded content = platform to get brand and creators connected via target audience and "mutual interest"


once the network is established, you want to increase the flow within it. workflow, but also direct the flow in favor of the company.


creator monetization is linked to "network compliance"
threat of de-platformization
subscriptions like Patreon separate payments from videos, network performance weights less (but is a "niche").  


And within the research I still see the need for tools like facebook, but not from facebook or on facebook. But the same is true for twitter and others.

All content will somehow be business-facing, with the creation of an business to influencer platform. As a service for businesses, targeting specific audiences. (as the old paradigm of "artistic control")

Facebook became, after a long period of time, an enhanced, socialized and production-wise verticalized version of youtube, with the same business model and the same principles for content creation as a means of community management. In parallel to that, Netflix is also doing the same, but they risk-manage their own productions by predictions through their feedback-loop with the otherwise passive audience.  

All content is measured against the underlying social graph (or relational databases), the heart and engine of Facebook (or each other platform), that makes this targeting and measurements possible in the first place.

so how do networks behave that don't have Facebooks' social graph at its core?

So what makes TikTok so different from the pre-existing networks?

















### Permanence, Availability & Censorship


### context, environment, expectations

### Flow-Opimization: Data, Perception, Production
How Flow and Habit are liked:

When social media networks extend their capabilities to video, this is an expensive tradeoff in the first place (processing power and bandwidth, storage maybe not so much). So was is the motivation behind it? What metrics make it a good investment for the company? This again, goes back to the engagement rates of the content:

- "flow" through scrolling photos vs the "flow" of viewing media content within the flow of scrolling
- fighting the meme / viral video > meaningful interaction vs reinforcing engagement
- viral videos increasing time on site
- Zuckerberg on adjusting video content, 1:11:00
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boj9eD0Wug8&feature=youtu.be
- video is not skim-able, you have to watch it for longer than a post or a picture, videos resonate more with our limbic system, less abstracted, more personal, more bandwidth, implicit information: body language, voice

Short video formats are going to die or will survive through iterative alterations or memification ("participation" culture).

- fluidity as a medium (apple)



time-preferences, survival, longevity > relevance
value in the body of work, archive is the store of value , not the content itself > habituation and ephemeral content, addiction, crisis
flow-optimization == engagement

the only way to express yourself is within the content itself while competing with other creators against limited attention spans.


"we live in public"
