## Image Production Cycles, Time Compression and Feedback Systems

> “The most basic decision-making skill is adapting to the tempo of your environment, and setting your own pace within it. It is significantly harder to become a pace-setter or pace-disruptor: somebody who can actually influence the tempo of the environment.”
– Venkatesh Rao (Tempo, A Sense of Timing)


As we could see in the early P2P file-sharing, the increased speed in the distribution process itself influences the production of music through faster feedback loops between production and publishing. But this is of course not only true for music, but ultimately any form of communication via the internet.

In terms of mobile media production within networks, it started with simple text, was extended with photos, now we have video and live-video broadcasts. The increasing capacities of mobile processing power and data transmissions and with that the possible forms and the bandwidth of communication have expanded exponentially. The same sequence and evolution was true with the desktop computer and its capabilities over time, but took much longer in comparison.


### General Trends within the Mobile Industry

- Frameworks, developer tools and unified devices make it easier create apps on the iPhone (verticality, efficiency, usability)
- Increasing the processing capacities of mobile devices (Moore's law)
- Increasing image quality of mobile devices (second or third order consequences of Moore's law)
- Increasing upload and download bandwidth via enhanced cellular / wireless broadband communication standards (3G, 4G and now 5G)
- Increasing bandwidth of communication formats (less compression needed, text to photo to video to live-video)
- Low-cost Android smartphones and apps bring mass-adoption (scale of available devices)
- Increasing user-base of mobile-first social media platforms (scale of services)



What I am observing is an increase in the speed of communication and with that a focus on the "now" and the "new", "hot topics" and "trends". And I am asking if this is really the path that "New Media" has to go, too? Trying to understand the fast and complex reality of today seems almost impossible with the amount of information out there.
There is more content created then ever before and you won't have the time to consume it or maybe further – act on it.

So what are the underlying changes? For that, we can look at different metrics which changed dramatically in the last decade.
I want to categorize these different modes of production we have seen historically under the aspects of "time-to-produce", "time-to-create",  or "time-to-publish" in relation to the moving image.
Through technological and procedural changes, we can see the shifts from filmmakers to video producers to content creators.


### Analog Film Production
This mode has the slowest feedback process within its production, but has to be shot with a lot of experience or knowledge and carefulness or awareness. The delay between shooting the film and seeing the result of it make probably the most demanding mode of production within this categories. In addition, the medium itself is scare and expensive. This makes this endeavor potentially a high risk due to a lot of uncertainties within the long process of production.

This mode inhabits the standard of "you make the film three times":
first when you shape the idea, second when filming it and third when you are editing. With each step the "original idea" is shaped by the reality and the constrains of each part in the process.

Furthermore, the distribution is limited, especially when it stays in its native production format for the audience. This includes the information asymmetry of the filmmaker who does not have a direct feedback loop or relationship to the audience. Only proxies with film critics and box offices as "success metrics".  


### Digital Film Production
The shift to the digital production of the previous mode creates more and faster feedback loops in the creation process.
Now the filmmaker is able to re-watch and re-shoot on the set, within the production itself. Digital storage solutions make attempts of a particular scene abundant and more playful in the way of finding the right performance in the frame.

Digital extends the first mode and creates possibilities of further iterations and on-set explorations of an idea within the process of production. This can be less "scripted" or "planed" and be therefore more process-orientated and organic.

The distribution model can be faster, but mostly uses the "traditional" ways of releasing the end-product through the cinema to enter the market.

As a side-note: network specific film productions from **Netflix (1997)**, **Amazon (1994)**, **Apple (1976)** and others are breaking or at least disrupting this product release cycle now, as well.


### Digital Web Video Production
The mode of digital video production increases the feedback loops even further. The products are smaller, easier to produce, fast to edit and can be influenced by the software capabilities and context of their release platform. The hosting on those platforms is potentially abundant - cost-free and almost unlimited in the case of **YouTube (2005)**, limited and with paid-subscriptions for higher quality streams and video on-demand solutions in the case of **Vimeo (2004)**.

But content created for Youtube specifically incentives the producers to create forms of "responsive sequences": video becomes a tool for community management because there is now the one-to-many, direct relationship or feedback mechanisms between the producer and the audience. I will go deeper into that in the chapter "what does the network want".

We can see that the mode of the network-favored production becomes continuous, we are familiar with from the television. But it is not a closed loop in itself, but more of a continuous loop that can be iterated and changed along the production and feedback of each of the released episodes, based on their "performance".


### Digital Content Production
Speaking of performance-based content: if you compress the complete process of production, editing and publishing into a single or very small moment, we are looking at the "Post", the "Story" and the "Meme".  

I would like to call them "hyper-responsive fragments" which are mostly defined by the applications and content standards and formats of the distribution network. The production process is based on immediate feedback and "visual action".

These "vertical production pipelines" include (in "optimal" conditions) an all-in-one solution for shooting, editing and releasing the video content as well as community management tools for interaction or referencing.

The more conversational the piece of content becomes, the shorter it gets, when we are speaking of "across content communication exchanges" and not within the medium of content itself.

Also the relationship between audience and producer changes because their "distance" becomes closer. You don't produce for "your" audience anymore, the producer and the audience become interchangeable for the contributions to the conversation.
