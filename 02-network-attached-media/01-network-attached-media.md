Network-Attached Media
======================

This chapter will focus on the histories of products and platforms, sharing mechanisms and centralization of access.
I will propose perspectives to understand the current context of media production and consumption, and what driving forces are at play.

The main distinction I would like to emphasis is between network-attached storage and network-attached media.
This separates the functions of sheer storage and distribution of a file to a medium that is actively shaped by the transmission and broadcasting mechanisms itself.

The second state, which inherits a bidirectional relationships between network and media, I will further describe in "what does the network want". As a general hypothesis I would propose that especially Apple's mobile operating system iOS and the interplay of their software and hardware are "the new medium", media networks themselves becomes the genres (with their specific viewing habits or habits of interaction and tools of production) which then trigger network- or genre-specific iterations in form of sub-genres.
