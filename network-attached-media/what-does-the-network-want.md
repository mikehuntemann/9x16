# What does the network want?


##Youtube

### 10 Fundamentals
Network-attatched video (NAC) does not want to be a one-hit-wonder. NAC wants to be repetative, continous and branded (recognizable, identifiable). It wants to be concise, in time but also in time to understand, so it favors the easy idea.
Through the network comes interactivity, which leads to a faster feedback loop (producer > community > producer) and a change in language. Direct communication is the ideal form of narration. Speaking directly into the camera, and therefore to the audience. You are also speaking to a specific community, a group of people with a collective interest in something, so be sure that you create content that specifically targets this audience. Your audience wants to see you in a predictable and for you sustainable timeframe, so make sure that you lower your production value to a minimum. To attract new viewers you can always talk about popular topics ("evergreens") or create content with a sense of usefulness ("how-to's").
Another way to a bigger audience is to make collaborations with already popular content creators which share a mutual community-based interest.

### Loyalty, Community Management and Viewing Habits
While Youtube is a place to host any kind of video content, the tendencies of the network lead to a specific formation of the video content itself (genres, production) and its channel (timeframe). The sequence of uploaded videos become a tool of community creation and management (subscribers), which is limited to Youtube and not the creator in the first place. A cross-platform community is therefore only possible with additional work and reinforcement. The audience of the channel builds the loyalty and their viewing habits to the platform first and the creator second, due to the mulitplicity of content creators around the world.


## Platform Stability
Changing algorithms for content discovery on the homepage and trending topics were problematic for content creators, who experienced massive drops in their views. And also UI/UX changes of the upload notifications interfere with the video content. By now, the audience has to manually activate channel specific video uploads. 
Platform changes are made by the company and often poorly communicated beforehand. There is no voice from the userbase, neither from the content creators nor the audience. Only a backlash and shitstorm after the changes became obvious.

### permanence, availablity, censorship
For my works in the past, I used Youtube as a database, an archive where a lot of atomized TV content (uploads after airtime, excerpts), documented talks and events as well as - needless to say - the "native" youtube content is published.

### context, environment, expectations
### video hosting is expensive (bandwidth + storage)
### Is YouTube already a legacy service?
> increased speed of production  
> screen-recordings w/ voiceovers to reduce time-to-publish
