Today, I want to give you a little preview or some kind of low res framework of my graduation project. 
For the last 16 months or so I am trying to figure out what really drives the digital landscape we more or less interact with. Most of us probably on a daily basis, some more active, “productive” and engaged, some more passive and in a observing manner. 
I also wanted to know what kinds of personal workflows are essential or needed when I do research online.

When I first started my working title was “move to the ocean” as a metaphor for the internet as one huge ecosystem where everything somehow connects or interacts. But also that it is a landscape that we are not able to fully grasp - on a physical level - because we don’t see or feel electric impulses in fibre-glass cables. The same is true for the ocean - near the surface we can (survive), but to really go deep we need, once again, technology that assists us to overcome the immense pressure and darkness.

When I officially started my project it became “verticality and the paradigm of mobile video”, where I wanted to explore the ongoing change in the standard of video (production) - switching from a horizontal orientation to a vertical one.
I wanted to know what events started this shift, who supported it, made it more mainstream or on what technologies and design principles or patterns the industry is build upon. 
Which ultimately ends in the question what does “native” (in terms of apps and media) in a mobile world mean?

To break it down into four separate but fully connected chapters (environments), which all developed in parallel, I propose the following frameworks of flow which can be distilled into “fluidity as a medium”:
ONE // The Physics (Operating System) > exploring “native” behavior
TWO // The Production (Workflow, Application) exploring “compression” of production
THREE // The Channels (output, internet platforms and flows of data, Network) exploring “circulation” (engagement, time on site, incentives)
ZERO // The Habit (Everyday Life) > exploring “repetitiveness”, self-disruption, habit breaking, from reactive to proactive , reconfigure, resisting hype / momentum

This leads to my thesis that the videos i have explored behave more like data than their predecessors or the way that videos “should” have been produced previously. 

ONE:
Start and End at the same time
Environment for production and consumption
Daily driver for digital communication
Always-on
Proactive and reactive (notifications)
Defaults, intentional usage
Rotational devices

Who controls the flow and therefore the state of success / the optimal experience?
