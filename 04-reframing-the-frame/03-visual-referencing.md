### Desktop Documentaries and "Visual Referencing"

Desktop Documentaries can be described as a collection of media content which are performed in the software environment. In this case, the environment is Apple's desktop operating system "macOS".

Kevin B. Lee, which I noted earlier, as well as Nick Briz are both Chicago-based media artists and have the same "school of thought". In their works they both reference the mid-70s "COPY-IT-RIGHT" approach by Phil Morton (and later jonCates) which ["encouraged people to make faithful copies, caring for and distributing Media Artworks as widely as possible"](https://web.archive.org/web/20180321192529/http://mediaart.historiesresearch.org/files/COPYITRIGHT_jonCates_May2009.pdf), who would later teach at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

In ["Apple Computers"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GyvH3LApDI) (2013), Briz sets the story in the software environment which he would then criticize for Apple's „pro-active decision-making“ for the consumers. Newer software updates would limit the systems backward compatebilites, functions and capabilities as a tradeoff to increase the "user experience and security" for the end user. But these decisions interfere with the artists, researchers and developers that wanted to experiment within these software environment. Within the work, Briz emphasis that [„copying is how creativity works“](https://youtu.be/1GyvH3LApDI?t=1170) and contrasts Apple's software policies and changes to the statements of Steve Job's early statements that they bootstrapped out of existing ideas and that [„Apple has always been shameless about stealing great ideas“](https://youtu.be/1GyvH3LApDI?t=1150).

Briz uses the desktop environment to compose different layers of video footage and recordings from the local filesystem as well as online sources containing websites, videos and songs. This way and also in harmony with the "COPY-IT-RIGHT" approach, Briz integrates the visual references to each source and does not try to hide its origins.   

The same is true for Kevin B. Lee's work ["Transformers - The Premake"](https://vimeo.com/94101046) (2014). Lee incorporates   
his on location research of fan labor with the fan-created footage on YouTube from the movies production process. He also makes a clear distinction between the filesystem (his personal footage) and online content (shared fan footage). He further iterates upon the technique and uses large grid systems and relocates the found-footage on Google Maps. His process is in general more "edited" and post-produced than we see it in the "native" functions of the operating system Briz has used, but this is just a side-note and not meant to be a critique on the editing style itself.

If would have to say how the to works differ the most, I would say that "Apple Computers" is there to make a statement, while "Transformers - The Premake" is more of a question, an exploration and the work a tool for the process of sense-making itself.

But now I would ask, are these works "open" or "good" enough to let other people "copy-their-work-right"? And I think the answer is no.
Let me explain why. Here I want to take a look at my process of creating the "TikTok Takeover: Everything is a Remix" case-study.


### Case-Study: "TikTok Takeover"
// Write about the process and experiences of working with the "actual" material, and screen-recordings
So I started to analyze the methods and approached within that genre.
