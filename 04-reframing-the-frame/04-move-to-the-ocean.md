### The Move to the Ocean
Road to Functional Referencing

> "Visualization, searchability, findability—these and many other new “media-independent techniques” (i.e. concepts implemented to work across many data types)"
– Lev Manovich (Software Takes Command (2013), p. 119)

> "There is no such thing as “digital media.” There is only software— as applied to media (or “content”). Or, to put this differently: for users who only interact with media content through application software, the “properties” of digital media are defined by the particular software as opposed to solely being contained in the actual content (i.e., inside digital files)."
– Lev Manovich (Software Takes Command (2013), p. 152)

> "Because all the new qualities of “digital media” are not situated “inside” the media objects. Rather, they all exist “outside”—as commands and techniques of media viewers, authoring software, animation, compositing, and editing software, game engine software, wiki software, and all other software 'species.'"
– Lev Manovich (Software Takes Command (2013), p. 149)

// Archiving, Time-Stamping, Hashing, Referencing, Building Recipes..
// project file is descriptive, how the material is used, and i had to recreate or consciously 
// Write about the experiences in "Real-Time Propaganda" and what I missed..

„Final Export“ which references the project files > links back to building blocks
Source code > binaries



The “rendered” image hides its software influences, obfuscates its creation and is therefore still seen as a “separate“ medium.
the final rendering should only happen when “watching” but not when “working” with the material
new modes and possibilities for the video essay, that can embrace visuality of the discussed material itself


Video file formats are their own silos!
From silos and containers to (performant, interoperable) file-system repositories
video to sketch file
“Zipped and playable” or “unzipped and editable”
hidden in plain sight!


I thought the initial “research tool” was on the application layer, but actually it is one layer below, how files are structured and stored, prepared and edited. The “actual tool” is the self-describing structure itself which is then application independent and can be used by “open-tools”


// What if you don't know if the project will become a video, a website, a PDF or a book? How do you then defer the decisions before it becomes a "product"? And what if it has to be cross-functional between those formats? How can this approach itself create "real collaboration" and not just a collection of "finished products", done separately?


Microblogging to MircoBlocking

Block collections become some sort of referencing /outlining tool for the long format


what are “browser-friendly” codecs to let the video assemble itself? > youtube: webm (VP8/9 + opus) > all streaming optimized (DASH) + wikipedia (VP9/8)
“Composition-friendly codecs for assets”


Now I point to the source with the link instead of “pinning” and therefore archiving for myself while providing it to others.
