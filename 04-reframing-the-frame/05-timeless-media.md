### "Timeless Media"?

> “Signals that are not repeated or repeatable 'die'.”
– Wendy Chun (Updating the Remain the Same: Habitual New Media) p. 52

Time expansion > short productions in cycles, series
Time compression > production for one, self-describing piece.

Or the hybrid because of the fast speed:
Production of shorter products which are self-describing but modular
> the curation of our own products > atomization
> the continuous search, the bigger underlying theme, your values and personal interest


All this research cries for a reconfiguration, a reboot.
We cannot go forward without some lessons we can take from that important step in the development of technology. You don’t have to be a fan of those platforms, but you can acknowledge the experiments made along the way.
You wouldn’t have done a better job as a Zuckerberg or whoever. It is part of the game. It is bootstrapping. This is evolution at its best. Time to kill the ill branch and start a new branch with a fresh new stack of underlying infrastructure.


How do we get the notion of “timelessness” into our practice? When “new media” always dies first, what do we have to change in order to make persist time or to (partially) remain?
This is fragmentation, atomization. Make it useful and usable, referential, by default.


“The genes who are good at building bodies, good at controlling processes of embryology to make bodies that have what it takes to preserve those genes and pass them on. A body is a survival machine and that is by far the most powerful way of interpreting what an individual organism is.”

We are already creating bodies of work, but more in terms of “physically scarce” or “information scarce”, therefore making things difficult to recreate, instead of “information abundant”. This is the next step.

A composer uses the framework of musical notation. Which is the abstraction or codification of music instruments in general and the sounds which can be produced.
Their work is not original to its core. Only the sequences and combinatorics on the layer above. They are creating patterns.
„Musical notation serves as a set of directions for a performer, but there is a whole continuum of possibilities concerning how much the performer determines the final form of the rendered work in performance.“ [Composers and performers (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composer#Composers_and_performers)

We architect, compose (creating the construct) and then we design within that framework.

This practice I see as the only real solution to keep up with the exponential pace of technology: sharing sources and templates, approaches and learnings.
Ultimately, to never do the same thing twice and keep on learning – thanks Jörn!
