### How to do Research in a dynamic, fast pace, complex, multi-media environment? (General)
you can not predict the future and know what you are going to learn
how to be as long as possible open to any kind of output or "product"?

"9x16" is about Know-how, an undirected research.
This work is a process, a series of experiments, an expedition.
A dense documentation and reflection of my personal experience how I work with the Internet.


### Messy Process, Well Documented

Cambridge Analytica,
Facebook,
list of sources,
how to research,
researching research tools,
building research tools,
screen research,
desktop documentary,
verticality,
paradigm shifts,
more sources,
more screen recordings,
more screenshots,
Notion app,
post-its,
timeline,
networks,
relational databases,
Mark Lombardi,
cards and threads,
atomizing content,
building sequences,
installation test,
analog maps,
digital archives,
exchange formats,
reference systems,
the hosting problem.




### Init
In April 2018 I made an early Twitter experiment and deconstructed articles into tweet-sized blocks.

So I started the “xResearch” blog on my website in august 2018, summarizing my daily research interests and thoughts on my practice and approaches. It is mostly about the complexity problem, information overload and how I try to handle it personally.
Back then, I thought my graduation project would be some sort of research tool for managing and archiving web-based data. But there were always the problems of keeping up with the references while taking notes and transcribing videos. I quit writing “publicly” after two weeks.
Throughout the next 6 weeks, I tracked every topic, every video, that would cross my screen, what I am intuitively "drifting" towards.
I compressed them into the major themes and topics as well as into “personal”, "technical", "methodical" and “institutional” categories. The bottomline is, I am somehow obsessed with databases, knowledge management, archiving and documenting.


The main problem was and still is interoperability.

I read "The Craft of Research" and closed the book after the sentence "don't use the internet." No answers here.

How to „write“ documents? How to „document“ the process?

Notion is great but it is for the end user or teams. But what if you would help to archive the web (as long as you need it) for others while you use it?

What happened, out of pure necessity, I got (partly) analog.
I documented everything in blocks of assets in form of knowledge and references on post-its and cards. The interfaces and applications are not good enough!










### Desktop Documentaries and "Visual Referencing"


"Video in a software Environment“

Nick Briz also from Chicago
Apple computers (2013)
„Pro-active decision-making“ for consumers
„Technological self-reliance“
Distribution religion book
Good artists copy, great artists steal“
„Apple is shameless about stealing great ideas“
„Copying is how creativity works“
„You can’t get something from nothing“
„Faithful reproduction“
„Creative Control“ > artistic control

„Visual referencing“
He makes one important distinction:
YouTube footage and the QuickTime Player as reference of local files he captured himself

Chicago "School of thought"
Phil Morton
COPY-IT-RIGHT encouraged people to make faithful copies, caring for and distributing the work as widely as possible.





### The Move to the Ocean
Road to Functional Referencing

> "Visualization, searchability, findability—these and many other new “media-independent techniques” (i.e. concepts implemented to work across many data types)"
– Lev Manovich (Software Takes Command (2013), p. 119)

> "There is no such thing as “digital media.” There is only software— as applied to media (or “content”). Or, to put this differently: for users who only interact with media content through application software, the “properties” of digital media are defined by the particular software as opposed to solely being contained in the actual content (i.e., inside digital files)."
– Lev Manovich (Software Takes Command (2013), p. 152)

> "Because all the new qualities of “digital media” are not situated “inside” the media objects. Rather, they all exist “outside”—as commands and techniques of media viewers, authoring software, animation, compositing, and editing software, game engine software, wiki software, and all other software 'species.'"
– Lev Manovich (Software Takes Command (2013), p. 149)


„Final Export“ which references the project files > links back to building blocks
Source code > binaries



The “rendered” image hides its software influences, obfuscates its creation and is therefore still seen as a “separate“ medium.
the final rendering should only happen when “watching” but not when “working” with the material
new modes and possibilities for the video essay, that can embrace visuality of the discussed material itself


Video file formats are their own silos!
From silos and containers to (performant, interoperable) file-system repositories
video to sketch file
“Zipped and playable” or “unzipped and editable”
hidden in plain sight!


I thought the initial “research tool” was on the application layer, but actually it is one layer below, how files are structured and stored, prepared and edited. The “actual tool” is the self-describing structure itself which is then application independent and can be used by “open-tools”



Microblogging to MircoBlocking

Block collections become some sort of referencing /outlining tool for the long format


what are “browser-friendly” codecs to let the video assemble itself? > youtube: webm (VP8/9 + opus) > all streaming optimized (DASH) + wikipedia (VP9/8)
“Composition-friendly codecs for assets”


Now I point to the source with the link instead of “pinning” and therefore archiving for myself while providing it to others.
