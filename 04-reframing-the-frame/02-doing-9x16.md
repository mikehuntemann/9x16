How to do research in a dynamic, fast pace, complex, limitless, "multi-media" environment?

If you can not predict the future and don't know what you are going to learn, how can my process be open to any kind of output or "product"?

> "Good architectures allow major architectural decisions to be deferred. The job of an architect is not to make decisions, (...) it is to defer decision as long as possible to allow the program to be build in the absence of decisions, so that the decisions can be made later, with the most possible information." – [Uncle Bob Martin ("The Principles of Clean Architecture")](https://youtu.be/o_TH-Y78tt4?t=3993)



"9x16" is about the "know-how", explored in a mostly undirected research.
This work itself is a process, a series of experiments, an expedition.
It is a documentation and reflection of my personal experience how I work with and sometime against the Internet in general, multiple social networks and applications.

### Init / Derivée / Log

This all started with a "Daily Log" of what I am actually doing every day. I wanted to expose myself to my own habits and what I "subconsciously" spend time with. I wanted to become self-aware of my process. I did it for 30 days which was then interrupted by the "Cambridge Analytica scandal", which happened around in March 2018, and I started documenting my viewing habits, while the news were unfolding. So the question then became how I would search for information and for that I also started creating primitive watchlists in my Markdown editor "Ulysses".

When I first tried to define my project under code name "Move to the Ocean" I wrote the following on March 24, 2018:

> Thesis in fragments  
File format structuring  
Browser / application, online/ offline usage  
„I can’t read whole texts anymore“
Why are you writing texts then?  
Bias towards linear / storytelling  
Referencing vs creating  
Lightness of being: curating, thought process, dynamic vs linear  
Video grid, video referencing network  
Science as referencing network on the meta level  
YouTube as one playlist vs recommendations

How to „write“ documents? How to „document“ the process? How to archive what happens in the browser or apps? How to create a "database" or network of (personal) knowledge? How to manage the "evidence"?

In April 2018, I made an early proof-of-concept Twitter experiment and deconstructed articles into tweet-sized blocks. And it actually worked pretty well, but there were more constrains because it is not meant to be a "offline-first" personal knowledge and research management and writing tool.

Shortly after, I started to work on a series of projects about habits (and the self-documentation of them in the form of YouTube videos) related to mobile devices and social networks called "Early Birds". This also resulted in the deconstruction of YouTube specific genres and gathering data for a knowledge graph. In parallel, I was doing research and developing strategies on user interfaces and user experiences in another project.

This is like a wholistic approach, which always can be viewed from two directions: the way software is designed for specific use-cases and how the users are actually using the software and what their expectations are.

The semester ended with a workshop on research, which was interesting to see that almost everyone is overwhelmed with the amount of information and that the process itself tends to be very messy and unpredictable.

In the same breath, my professors told me to "plan" and "outline" my graduation project. And I couldn't do it. But I started documenting again.

In August 2018, I started the [“xResearch”](https://web.archive.org/web/20191120184646/http://blog.mikehuntemann.de/) blog on my website, summarizing my daily research interests and thoughts on my practice and approaches. It is mostly about the complexity problem, information overload and how I try to handle it personally. I quit writing “publicly” after two weeks.

Throughout the next 6 weeks, I tracked every topic, every video, that would cross my screen, what I was intuitively "drifting" towards.
I compressed them into the major themes and topics as well as into “personal”, "technical", "methodical" and “institutional” categories. The bottomline is: I am somehow obsessed with databases, knowledge management, archiving and documenting.

This was overwhelming, so I read "The Craft of Research" (19.09.2018) and closed the book after the sentence "Don't use the internet for your research." Error 404, Answers Not Found.
One could argue that academic research doesn't like internet references.
This is interesting, but more to that later.

> I am studying the methods and processes of data collection and management because I want to find out if there are basic underlying principles in order to help other researchers to handle digital complexity with a set of tools

> What if there were no documents anymore, just fragments?
How would research work when behaving more like email for quick incoming chunks? Rearranging, evolving.

This was also the time, somewhere around mid of October, that I would take my content from the temporary Wordpress blog and converting every entry to a Markdown file and putting it into single files locally on my computer and synced it to a Github repository. I used Tower to push my new commits to keep the history of each file over time. For writing I used Atom, an open source, extendable code editor developed by Github.
This way I could see the rendered Markdown file with a default styling and see all the changes made between the different commits.
I stopped shortly after but came back to it for the document you are reading right now.


The main problem was and still is interoperability and the loss of consistent references and information within the research process.
Basically, all my notes were now made in the default "Notes" app, just for convenience and mobile syncing reasons. And it worked, for a while at least.

The new semester introduced me to the works of Kevin B. Lee, his video essays and visual approaches how to analyze and dissect visual content within video formats. I loved his work, but in hindsight it gave me the notion, that "my solution" should not be "text-based" because I am a "visual" researcher, studying "visual" communications. That is probably the biggest misconception throughout my studies, and gave me always misleading signals what my "job" as a student within the new media department should be. But more to that also later!

Then I found the "Notion" app in April 2019, which was great and "block-based". So I converted all my notes into the applications database, were I would now be able to create structured databases for different kinds of topics. It is a pretty neat management tool, but I didn't really stick over the complete process of writing, "Notes" was always faster and leaner, more focused, easier to dump thoughts into it.
But it would stay as a management tool for catalogs of digital and analog resources and as a directory where I took the notes to each source.

Strangely, or maybe out of pure necessity, I then got partly analog.
Writing and referencing interesting snippets of information and quotes from books, creating an overview of what I could permanently look at.

In this way, I documented everything in little blocks of assets in form of knowledge and references on post-its. The interfaces of the applications were just not good enough for this messy, personal, organic process with a lot of fragmented information!

But there was another problem: I couldn't reference the visuals.
Which brought me back to the possibility of doing a desktop documentary.
So I started to analyze the methods and approached within that genre.
