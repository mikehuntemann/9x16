How to do research in a dynamic, fast pace, complex, limitless, "multi-media" environment?

If you can not predict the future and don't know what you are going to learn, how can my process be open to any kind of output or "product"?

> "Good architectures allow major architectural decisions to be deferred. The job of an architect is not to make decisions, (...) it is to defer decision as long as possible to allow the program to be build in the absence of decisions, so that the decisions can be made later, with the most possible information." – [Uncle Bob Martin ("The Principles of Clean Architecture")](https://youtu.be/o_TH-Y78tt4?t=3993)



"9x16" is about the "know-how", explored in a mostly undirected research.
This work itself is a process, a series of experiments, an expedition.
It is a documentation and reflection of my personal experience how I work with and sometime against the Internet in general, multiple social networks and applications.

### Init / Derivée
In April 2018, I made an early Twitter experiment and deconstructed articles into tweet-sized blocks.

In August 2018, I started the [“xResearch”](https://web.archive.org/web/20191120184646/http://blog.mikehuntemann.de/) blog on my website, summarizing my daily research interests and thoughts on my practice and approaches. It is mostly about the complexity problem, information overload and how I try to handle it personally.
Back then, I thought my graduation project would be some sort of research tool for managing and archiving web-based data. But there were always the problems of keeping up with the references while taking notes and transcribing videos. I quit writing “publicly” after two weeks.

Throughout the next 6 weeks, I tracked every topic, every video, that would cross my screen, what I am intuitively "drifting" towards.
I compressed them into the major themes and topics as well as into “personal”, "technical", "methodical" and “institutional” categories. The bottomline is: I am somehow obsessed with databases, knowledge management, archiving and documenting.

The Cambridge Analytica incident happened around that time, and I started documenting, while the news were unfolding, how I would search for information and created primitive watchlists.     

How to „write“ documents? How to „document“ the process? How to archive my browsing?

This was overwhelming, so I read "The Craft of Research" and closed the book after the sentence "Don't use the internet for your research." Error 404, Answers Not Found.
One could argue that academic research doesn't like internet references.
This is interesting, but more to that later.

The main problem was and still is interoperability and the loss of consistent references and information within the research process.
Basically, all my notes were now made in the default "Notes" app, just for convenience and mobile syncing reasons. And it worked, for a while at least.

Then I found the "Notion" app, which was great. So I converted all my notes into the applications database, were I would now be able to create structured databases for different kinds of topics. It is a pretty neat management tool, but I didn't really stick over the complete process.

Strangely, or maybe out of pure necessity, I got (partly) analog.
Writing and referencing interesting snippets of information and quotes from books, creating an overview of what I was permanently looking at.

In this way, I documented everything in blocks of assets in form of knowledge and references on post-its and cards. The interfaces of the applications are not good enough!

But there was another problem: I couldn't reference the visuals.
Which brought me back to the desktop documentaries.
