### How to do Research in a dynamic, fast pace, complex, multi-media environment? (General)
you can not predict the future and know what you are going to learn
how to be as long as possible open to any kind of output or "product"?

"9x16" is about Know-how, an undirected research.
This work is a process, a series of experiments, an expedition.
A dense documentation and reflection of my personal experience how I work with the Internet.

What happened, out of pure necessity, I got (partly) analog.
I documented everything in blocks of assets in form of knowledge and references on post-its and cards. The interfaces and applications are not good enough!

### Init
In April 2018 I made an early Twitter experiment and deconstructed articles into tweet-sized blocks.

So I started the “xResearch” blog on my website in august 2018, summarizing my daily findings and thoughts on my practice and approaches. It is mostly about the complexity problem, information overload and how I try to handle it.
Back then, I thought my graduation project would be some sort of research tool for managing and archiving web-based data. But there were alway problems of keeping the references while taking notes and transcribing videos. I quit writing “publicly” after two weeks.
throughout the next 6 weeks, I tracked what every topic, every video, that crossed my screen long enough to see, what I am actually looking for.
I compressed them into the major themes and topics as well as into “personal” and “institutional” categories. Bottomline is, I am somehow obsessed with databases and knowledge management.

The main problem was and still is interoperability.

I read "the craft of research" and closed the book at the sentence "don't use the internet." No answers here.

How to „write“ documents? How to „document“ the process?

Notion is great but it is for the end user or teams. But what if you would help to archive the web (as long as you need it) for others while you use it?

I thought the initial “research tool” was on the application layer, but actually it is one layer below, how files are structured and stored, prepared and edited. The “actual tool” is the self-describing structure itself which is then application independent and can be used by “open-tools”

### "Timeless Media"?

> “Signals that are not repeated or repeatable 'die'.”
– Wendy Chun (Updating the Remain the Same: Habitual New Media) p. 52

Time expansion > short productions in cycles, series
Time compression > production for one, self-describing piece.

Or the hybrid because of the fast speed:
Production of shorter products which are self-describing but modular
> the curation of our own products > atomization
> the continuous search, the bigger underlying theme, your values and personal interest


All this research cries for a reconfiguration, a reboot.
We cannot go forward without some lessons we can take from that important step in the development of technology. You don’t have to be a fan of those platforms, but you can acknowledge the experiments made along the way.
You wouldn’t have done a better job as a Zuckerberg or whoever. It is part of the game. It is bootstrapping. This is evolution at its best. Time to kill the ill branch and start a new branch with a fresh new stack of underlying infrastructure.


How do we get the notion of “timelessness” into our practice? When “new media” always dies first, what do we have to change in order to make persist time or to (partially) remain?
This is fragmentation, atomization. Make it useful and usable, referential, by default.


“The genes who are good at building bodies, good at controlling processes of embryology to make bodies that have what it takes to preserve those genes and pass them on. A body is a survival machine and that is by far the most powerful way of interpreting what an individual organism is.”

We are already creating bodies of work, but more in terms of “physically scarce” or “information scarce”, therefore making things difficult to recreate, instead of “information abundant”. This is the next step.

A composer uses the framework of musical notation. Which is the abstraction or codification of music instruments in general and the sounds which can be produced.
Their work is not original to its core. Only the sequences and combinatorics on the layer above. They are creating patterns.
„Musical notation serves as a set of directions for a performer, but there is a whole continuum of possibilities concerning how much the performer determines the final form of the rendered work in performance.“ [Composers and performers (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composer#Composers_and_performers)

We architect, compose (creating the construct) and then we design within that framework.



### From Visual Referencing to Functional Referencing

„Video in a software Environment“

Nick Briz also from Chicago
Apple computers (2013)
„Pro-active decision-making“ for consumers
„Technological self-reliance“
Distribution religion book
Good artists copy, great artists steal“
„Apple is shameless about stealing great ideas“
„Copying is how creativity works“
„You can’t get something from nothing“
„Faithful reproduction“
„Creative Control“ > artistic control


Kevin b. Lee
Transformers the premake (2014)
„Visual referencing“
He makes one important distinct:
YouTube footage and the QuickTime Player as reference of local files he captured himself

Phil Morton
COPY-IT-RIGHT encouraged people to make faithful copies, caring for and distributing the work as widely as possible.


„Final Export“ which references the project files > links back to building blocks
Source code > binaries

> "Visualization, searchability, findability—these and many other new “media-independent techniques” (i.e. concepts implemented to work across many data types)"
– Lev Manovich (Software Takes Command (2013), p. 119)

> "There is no such thing as “digital media.” There is only software— as applied to media (or “content”). Or, to put this differently: for users who only interact with media content through application software, the “properties” of digital media are defined by the particular software as opposed to solely being contained in the actual content (i.e., inside digital files)."
– Lev Manovich (Software Takes Command (2013), p. 152)

> "Because all the new qualities of “digital media” are not situated “inside” the media objects. Rather, they all exist “outside”—as commands and techniques of media viewers, authoring software, animation, compositing, and editing software, game engine software, wiki software, and all other software 'species.'"
– Lev Manovich (Software Takes Command (2013), p. 149)

The “rendered” image hides its software influences, obfuscates its creation and is therefore still seen as a “separate“ medium.
the final rendering should only happen when “watching” but not when “working” with the material
new modes and possibilities for the video essay, that can embrace visuality of the discussed material itself


Video file formats are their own silos!
From silos and containers to (performant, interoperable) file-system repositories
video to sketch file
“Zipped and playable” or “unzipped and editable”


### The Move to the Ocean

Microblogging to MircoBlocking

Block collections become some sort of referencing /outlining tool for the long format


what are “browser-friendly” codecs to let the video assemble itself? > youtube: webm (VP8/9 + opus) > all streaming optimized (DASH) + wikipedia (VP9/8)
“Composition-friendly codecs for assets”


Now I point to the source with the link instead of “pinning” and therefore archiving for myself while providing it to others.
