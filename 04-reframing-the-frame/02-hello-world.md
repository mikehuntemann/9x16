## Hello World (Intro)

### P2P
I am a child of the peer-to-peer file-sharing age. I remember being 13 years old, trying to download the movie Saw on my fathers computer with a 56k modem. in optimal conditions, while blocking any availability via the phone line, I would have downloaded for almost 30h to get the full download done.  
Because I didnâ€™t want to let my parents know what I was doing on the computer I only had a timeframe of a few hours, which ended up with me watching the opening credits from the movie. 30 seconds in, the file ended and nothing happened.  
Welcome to the internet in 2005!

### Mobile Devices
In the early days of using the internet, my interest was more on the music file sharing side. Researching songs within the movies I had watched and downloading them afterwards. I was building my own music library which then burned onto CDs, then copied to MP3 players or phones, later synced to my iPod Nano 2nd gen in the year 2007, which was also my first Apple product. This was the time where I always carried two devices with me: a mobile phone and a dedicated device for music. This hold on for about 4 years: a smartphone and an iPod Touch 2nd gen, which curiously worked way better than the smartphone I had back then. So I switched to the iPhone 4 in late 2010 and never looked back, until recently.
