### Hello World (Intro)

### P2P
I am a child of the peer-to-peer file-sharing age. I remember being 13 years old, trying to download the movie Saw on my fathers computer with a 56k modem. in optimal conditions, while blocking any availability via the phone line, I would have downloaded for almost 30h to get the full download done.  
Because I didnâ€™t want to let my parents know what I was doing on the computer I only had a timeframe of a few hours, which ended up with me watching the opening credits from the movie. 30 seconds in, the file ended and nothing happened.  
Welcome to the internet in 2005!

### Mobile Devices
In the early days of using the internet, my interest was more on the music file sharing side. Researching songs within the movies I had watched and downloading them afterwards. I was building my own music library which then burned onto CDs, then copied to MP3 players or phones, later synced to my iPod Nano 2nd gen in the year 2007, which was also my first Apple product. This was the time where I always carried two devices with me: a mobile phone and a dedicated device for music. This hold on for about 4 years: a smartphone and an iPod Touch 2nd gen, which curiously worked way better than the smartphone I had back then. So I switched to the iPhone 4 in late 2010 and never looked back, until recently.

### Real-Time Propaganda
For my works in the past, I used Youtube as a database, an archive where a lot of atomized TV content (uploads after airtime, excerpts), documented talks and events as well as - needless to say - the "native" youtube content is published.

### Framing the Frame

What problem are you addressing:
Inspirations / previous projects:
Trending topics in the media, and how waves of media emerge (via a tulip bubble)
(Do you still care?) How do media propagate, why did the attention dissipate so fast?
Technologies of every day life that integrate well with our habits (morning routine videos)

peaks in the media are getting closer together.
Just as fast as how different content formats are also emerging and disappearing (seems like this is something specific to new media)
Networked attached videos. The videos exist in the network, because their mediation is extended to the audience participation.


Questions / problem:
In the field of social media content is dependent - in form and distribution - on multiple actors: hardware, software, platform, the user, consumer, .... they all have certain value or assets they control.
In former times (film, television)  the field was more static. and top down.
Now we see emergent patterns because of the different roles of the different actors in this network.
But how do you research, or sketch such a field, how do you research it?

9x16: Verticality and the Paradigm of Mobile Video
is a case study of the emergence of one output.
A forensic research or analysis of ....
the TikTok challenge.


There are patterns of emergence of content, of adaption of
How do you research this field > what is this field of research, what are research tools,
how did particular new (video) formats emerge in an environment governed by major platforms, hardware and content creators.

The hosting problem.
