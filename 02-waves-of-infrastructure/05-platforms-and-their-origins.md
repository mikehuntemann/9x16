### Platforms and their Origins (Specific)

In the following I will try to outline the different bootstrapping approaches of the companies and internet platforms that more or less surround us on a daily basis.


The **Internet (1969)** itself is bootstrapping from the telephone lines. This idea repurposes existing application-dependent infrastructure ("making a phone-call") to a general purpose, application-independent infrastructure ("sending information").    

**Google (1998)** is bootstrapping from the internets native hyperlink  and publicly accessible content for its algorithmic indexing curation.


**Facebook (2004)** is bootstrapping from already verified university email addresses. Only with the existing work of authorization through the universities it was possible to build the base for an "authenticity" based social network.


**Reddit (2005)** is bootstrapping from the early newsgroups and forums which were often topic dependent, Reddit generalized this concept.


**Amazon AWS (2006)** is bootstrapping from the "general purpose" hardware stack and combined it into one easy-to-use, subscription-based service. Every service had to run on its own servers, not anymore.


**YouTube (2006)** is bootstrapping from video-capable digital cameras, which already were in use but didn't had "free" storage on the internet to be shared publicly and similar media sharing and community platforms like **Flickr (2004)**, which is based on photography.

**Twitter (2006)** is bootstrapping from SMS text-messages to make group chats possible and evolved quickly into a service to comment on live events.


**Instagram (2010)** is bootstrapping from the Facebook Platform integration for making an account and sharing to the FB friends-list. In addition to that, they use the hardware and software capabilities for photo production and editing that are coming with the iPhone.

**Vine (2012)** is bootstrapping from Instagram, basically worked as an exact design clone with the focus on square videos instead of photos. It also has integrated perfectly with Twitter's news feed.

**Snapchat (2011)** and **WhatsApp (2009)** are both bootstrapping from the smartphone's contacts to function as "close-friends" network. Snapchat especially focuses, like instagram, on the iPhones photo production and editing capabilities.


**TikTok (2017)** as well as **Musical.ly (2014)** are bootstrapping from viral videos that are a side effect of all previous "general purpose" social media platforms. In addition, they both profit from already centralized music platforms such as **Spotify (2006)** which made music royalty payments easier.
