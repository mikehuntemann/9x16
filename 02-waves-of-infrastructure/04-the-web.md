### The Web (Waves)

#### Passive Web
The **Web 1.0** permitted people with the browser the ability to read.
It was content - mostly text and photos â€“ that was hosted by one person or group, open to the public. This was a one-dimensional relationship between the publisher and the reader, the same asymmetric relationship we have seen with newspapers, television and movies but now open to everyone that is able to setup their server, domain and website.

#### Interactive Web
**Web 2.0** added the capabilities of writing, the paradigm that is very present today. The twist in that is that you don't "own" any of the content you host on those platforms. For more convenience, more adoption and therefore more people within that community that could eventually be exposed to your content. Platforms integrate the crucial parts of content discovery within a unified interface, that is for most people easily accessible. It started on the desktop but expanded extensively with the emergence of smartphones for real-time updates and an inclusive image production and broadcasting pipeline.

// private protocols: stable mediums to communicate within the network
// reputation, relevance & personalization

#### Distributed Web
In the last few years a different movement started to grow again: the idea about linked data, the **Web 3.0**. This paradigm adds the capability of verifiability (trust) to the reading and writing procedures, which I will explain in the last chapter "Rebalancing Verticality".
