## The Web (Waves)
The user-facing web, with graphical interfaces in the browser, was the kickstarter for the mass adoption of the internet we know today.   
Easy to execute, point-to-click gestures with the mouse allowed users to "just use" the services on the web, without learning more about the underlying technologies. They were literally only surfing on the surface.

### Passive Web
The **Web 1.0** permitted people with the browser the ability to read.
It was content - mostly text and photos â€“ that was hosted by one person or group, open to the public. This was a one-dimensional relationship between the publisher and the reader, the same asymmetric relationship we have seen with newspapers, television and movies but now open to potentially anyone who is able to setup a server, domain and website.

### Interactive Web
**Web 2.0** added the capability of writing, the paradigm that is very present today. The twist is that you lose control over the content or infrastructure with the services and platforms you use. For more convenience, more adoption and therefore more people within that community that could eventually be exposed to your content. Platforms integrate the crucial parts of content discovery within a unified interface, that is for most people easily accessible. It started on the desktop but expanded extensively with the emergence of smartphones for real-time updates.
This is the consequence we experience with today's verticals: a small set of big companies that further and further funnel services and devices into their networks. General purpose devices become access-hubs to one specific service-provider, the smartphone as the main media production tool becomes streamlined and the applications more network-specific.

### Distributed Web
In the last few years a different paradigm started to evolve: encryption-based protocols and ideas about linked data within decentralized networks, the **Web 3.0**. This paradigm adds the capability of verifiability and trust to the reading and writing procedures, which I will explain in the last chapter "Rebalancing Verticality".
