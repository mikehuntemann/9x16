### Bootstrapping (Context)

This pattern is what i call *bootstrapping*: building on top of already known ideas and structures to build more complex structures. You don't have to invent the basic Lego brick each time you want to build something, once it is there, you can just stack them into all kinds of forms.
But these modular frameworks limit your possibilities of building as well as thinking. In the moment you submit to the idea of the Lego framework you are bound to the underlying principles and resolution of how to build things: frameworks suppress ideas that are not compatible this existing modules. The same principle works for software and hardware.

Through the lens of bootstrapping you can get a grasp on how technologies somehow lead naturally to the next idea. IMHO, there is a difference between "disruptive" innovation (implies a paradigm shift on a deeper infrastructural level) and iteration as an alteration of applications build upon the same infrastructural level which tends to be a more efficient version of the status quo.

> "[Bootstrapping] is the process of starting a computer, specifically with regard to starting its software. The process involves a chain of stages, in which at each stage a smaller, simpler program loads and then executes the larger, more complicated program of the next stage. It is in this sense that the computer "pulls itself up by its bootstraps", i.e. it improves itself by its own efforts."
