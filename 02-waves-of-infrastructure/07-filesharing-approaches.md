## File-sharing Approaches, Music Distribution, Content Management (Specific)
Before we are going into the specifics of mobile image production, I first want to make the case for the "natural states" of technological developments. This can be seen as a small case-study of "frameless media" which can help us to identify a general patterns of distribution without the influence of "visual interoperability". IMHO, this process becomes becomes even more clear due to the relatively small file size, cost and general interest of music, as well as the speed in which the music industry got disrupted by internet technologies.

This will lead to an explanation why we inevitably had to experience this extreme form of verticality. I now want to sketch out the underlying mechanics and limitations of the three waves of infrastructural shifts that power, manage and control instances of the internet and what trade-offs where made by the users over time.



### Wave One: P2P File-sharing (distributed)
> as part of the early web 2.0
> peer-to-peer software to exchange files
> bandwidth: upload / download asymmetry
> another problem: always-on, only available when other participants are only, synchronicity
> file management is completely in the hands of the users


Back in the days, peer-to-peer file-sharing had the missing incentive structure for offering the content on torrents which led to a marketplace on the basis of altruism, therefore paving the way for the "free-rider problem". This mixed together with a limited upload capacity which was asymmetrical to the download as well as the regulatory framework that suppressed the usage by the narration of piracy ("You wouldn't steal a car!") and threats of potential legal action.



### Wave Two: File-sharing Services (decentralized)
decentralized services "solved" the problems / bypassed the downsides / made trade-offs, so that there only had to be a one-time upload from the user with its limited upload bandwidth and then the service would handle all the download traffic, often limiting the amounts of downloads or the speed of bandwidth with freemium business models to pay for the servers.
The browser was the only tool needed and download links could be shared easily.  
> file management is still in the hands of the user


### Wave Two-to-Three: Apple, Trust and the Music Industry (centralized)
> filesystem abstraction, closed system
> but bootstrapped from p2p file-sharing and ripping cds
> managing the music files in an application dependent system for specific music hardware (iPod), then became general purpose (iPhone) which inherits the same control mechanisms
> closed system with syncing increased trust of the industry to prevent the possibility of mobile device file-sharing


### Wave Three: Streaming Services & Platforms (vertical)
streaming services made file-sharing almost unnecessary for mainstream music, "all in one place", easy to navigate, no individual payments for a song, easy to mange, personal playlists
> file management through platform
also changes of industry through publishing on Soundcloud
> artists want their music to be "free" and used to generate network effects to indirect earn money through other forms of products (events, premium content, etc.)
