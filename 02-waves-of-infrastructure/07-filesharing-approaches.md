## File-sharing Approaches, Music Distribution, Content Management (Specific)

Before we are going into the specifics of mobile image production, I first want to make the case for the "natural states" of technological developments, the markets and the legal system. This can be seen as a small case-study of "frameless media" which can help us to identify a general patterns of distribution without the influence of "visual interoperability". IMHO, this patterns becomes even more clear due to the relatively small file sizes, costs and the general interest in music, as well as the speed in which the music industry got disrupted by these internet technologies.

This will lead to an explanation why we inevitably had to experience this extreme form of verticality. I now want to sketch out the underlying mechanics and limitations of the three waves of infrastructural shifts that power, manage and control instances of the internet and what trade-offs where made by the users and where digital files are stores and managed over time.

### Wave One: P2P File-sharing (distributed)
As part of and a parallel approach / development of the early web 2.0, peer-to-peer protocols enabled participants to exchange files without having a dedicated server but only the personal computer which acts as server and client at the same time. P2P became popular especially for music sharing with the emergence of Napster, the first generation of these exchange services. Parts of the infrastructure still included centralized indexing servers or directories of available files, which can be seen as  "single point of failure" for these networks because of the legal frameworks they are operating in as a company.


### Protocols and applications (1999-2008)
// Edit: Separate Protocols and applications?

- Napster (Centralized File Directory + P2P, TCP Protocol, Jun 1999)
- iMesh (Client, centralized IM2Net, Nov 1999)
- Gnutella (Client and decentralized Protocol, Mar 2000)
- Limewire (Client for Gnutella and later BitTorrent, May 2000)
- eDonkey2000 (Client, Multi-source File Transfer Protocol, Sep 2000)
- Bearshare (Rebooted iMesh, Client for Gnutella, Dec 2000)
- FastTrack (Hybrid of Napster and Gnutella, Protocol, Mar 2001)
- Kazaa (Client for FastTrack from FastTrack Devs, Mar 2001)
- BitTorrent (Protocol, Jul 2001)
- eMule (enhanced eDonkey Network Client, May 2002)
- Vuze (Client for BitTorrent, Jun 2003)
- The Pirate Bay (Search Engine / Index for Torrent Files, Sep 2003)
- uTorrent (Client for BitTorrent, Sep 2005)
- Transmission (Client for BitTorrent, Sep 2005)

![Wave One](../assets/file-sharing.png)

- no accounts / identity / verification needed
- file management is completely in the hands of the participants
- protocol as transport layer, distributing the files with different approaches, "download cooperation" that is not limited to one specific participant in the network
- influencing the content of the music itself, availability of references / samples, speed of production and speed of release + potential circulation, "production value" / "polished products"

Peer-to-Peer file-sharing had the missing incentive structure for offering the content permanently or 24h a day because the personal computers were not meant to be "always-on" devices. This led to a marketplace on the basis of altruism, therefore paving the way for the "free-rider problem". The problem describes the state of a market which becomes dysfunctional due to lack of transactional value or free access to products where the users end up by only taking and not contributing back.
In combination with a limited upload capacity which was asymmetrical to the download (56k, ISDN, ADSL), which can be seen as a Web 1.0 read-only artifact, compromises more bandwidth for the download within the physical connection, which technically further incentives to "just use" services or to be a "end-user" – a client or end-user instead of a server. In addition to all the technical limitations, the location-based regulatory frameworks  suppressed the usage of file-sharing by the narration of piracy (stresses existing or legacy copyright and intellectual property laws) (especially in terms of movies: "You wouldn't steal a car!") and threats of potential legal action.

### Wave Two: File-sharing Services (decentralized)
Decentralized services (here used as "multiplicity of platforms with the same function") displaced the problems of on-demand availability through the network-attached storage, provided by the service operators. Now, files for distribution only had to be uploaded once from the user who was still limited by the internet providers upload capacity. The user transfers the responsibility and the management of availability (always-on or promise) to the service who would handle all the download traffic from all downloading users.

- no accounts / identity / verification needed


- Rapidshare (May, 2002)
- YouSendIt (Early 2004)
- Megaupload (Mar, 2005)
- Mediafire ("Unlimited Upload", Jun 2006)
- GigaSize ("1,5GB Uploads", Aug 2006)
- FilesTube ("Search for Uploaded Files", Jun 2007)
- Zippyshare ("500MB Uploads", 2006 / Sep 2007*)
- Hotfile ("400MB Uploads", Mar 2009)
- Fileserve (Apr 2010*)

The scale of users and the costs for available storage forced service providers to limit the amounts of possible downloads or the speed of download bandwidth to implement freemium business models, where the premium users would pay for the actual costs of hosting in favor of immediate, unlimited and simultaneous downloads – regaining all of the "benefits" of the original P2P vision / version.
For the users, the browser was the only tool needed and (temporary) download links could be shared easily in forums, chats or could be found with Google search queries. "One-click file hosting" didn't require specific technical knowledge and was more convenient and accessible for end-users. After downloading the file, the management of the music library on the local file system is still in the hands of the user and had to be done mostly by hand for each download.

### Wave Two-to-Three: Apple, Trust and the Music Industry (centralized)
- filesystem abstraction, closed system
- application as medium specific file organization tool that is not provided by the general purpose file-explorers
- but bootstrapped from p2p file-sharing and ripping cds
- managing the music files in an application dependent system for specific music hardware (iPod), then became general purpose (iPhone) which inherits the same control mechanisms
- closed system with "external syncing" (static storage vs transport) increased trust of the industry to prevent the possibility of mobile device file-sharing
- company shifts from general purpose hardware to media distribution as a service + media specific handheld hardware to media and application distribution as a service + general purpose handheld hardware

// Note: Add iPod + iPhone to 'Platforms and their Origins' or just in this paragraph explained?


### Wave Three: Streaming Services & Platforms (vertical)
streaming services made file-sharing almost unnecessary for mainstream music, "all in one place", easy to navigate, no individual payments for a song, easy to mange, personal playlists
- file management through platform
also changes of industry through publishing on Soundcloud
- artists want their music to be "free" and used to generate network effects to indirect earn money through other forms of products (events, premium content, etc.)
