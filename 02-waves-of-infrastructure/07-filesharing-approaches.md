## File-sharing Approaches, Music Distribution, Content Management (Specific)

Before we are going into the specifics of mobile image production, I first want to make the case for the "natural states" of technological developments, the markets and the legal system. This can be seen as a small case-study of "frameless media" which can help us to identify a general patterns of distribution without the influence of "visual interoperability". IMHO, this patterns becomes even more clear due to the relatively small file sizes, costs and the general interest in music, as well as the speed in which the music industry got disrupted by these internet technologies.

This will lead to an explanation why we inevitably had to experience this extreme form of verticality. I now want to sketch out the underlying mechanics and limitations of the three waves of infrastructural shifts that power, manage and control instances of the internet and what trade-offs where made by the users and where digital files are stores and managed over time.

### Wave One: P2P File-sharing (distributed)
// Edit: distributed or semi-decentralized?

As part of and a parallel approach / development of the early web 2.0, peer-to-peer protocols enabled participants to exchange files without having a dedicated server but only the personal computer which acts as server and client at the same time. P2P became popular especially for music sharing with the emergence of Napster, the first generation of these exchange services. Parts of the infrastructure still included centralized indexing servers or directories of available files, which can be seen as  "single point of failure" for these networks because of the legal frameworks they are operating in as a company.


### Protocols and applications (1999-2008)
// Edit: Separate Protocols and applications?

- Napster (Centralized File Directory + P2P, TCP Protocol, Jun 1999)
- iMesh (Client, centralized IM2Net, Nov 1999)
- Gnutella (Client and decentralized Protocol, Mar 2000)
- Limewire (Client for Gnutella and later BitTorrent, May 2000)
- eDonkey2000 (Client, Multi-source File Transfer Protocol, Sep 2000)
- Bearshare (Rebooted iMesh, Client for Gnutella, Dec 2000)
- FastTrack (Hybrid of Napster and Gnutella, Protocol, Mar 2001)
- Kazaa (Client for FastTrack from FastTrack Devs, Mar 2001)
- BitTorrent (Protocol, Jul 2001)
- eMule (enhanced eDonkey Network Client, May 2002)
- Vuze (Client for BitTorrent, Jun 2003)
- The Pirate Bay (Search Engine / Index for Torrent Files, Sep 2003)
- uTorrent (Client for BitTorrent, Sep 2005)
- Transmission (Client for BitTorrent, Sep 2005)

![Wave One](../assets/file-sharing.png)

- no accounts / identity / verification needed
- file management is completely in the hands of the participants
- protocol as transport layer, distributing the files with different approaches, "download cooperation" that is not limited to one specific participant in the network
- influencing the content of the music itself, availability of references / samples, speed of production and speed of release + potential circulation, "production value" / "polished products"

Peer-to-Peer file-sharing had the missing incentive structure for offering the content permanently or 24h a day because the personal computers were not meant to be "always-on" devices. This led to a marketplace on the basis of altruism, therefore paving the way for the "free-rider problem". The problem describes the state of a market which becomes dysfunctional due to lack of transactional value or free access to products where the users end up by only taking and not contributing back.
In combination with a limited upload capacity which was asymmetrical to the download (56k, ISDN, ADSL), which can be seen as a Web 1.0 read-only artifact, compromises more bandwidth for the download within the physical connection, which technically further incentives to "just use" services or to be a "end-user" – a client or end-user instead of a server. In addition to all the technical limitations, the location-based regulatory frameworks  suppressed the usage of file-sharing by the narration of piracy (stresses existing or legacy copyright and intellectual property laws) (especially in terms of movies: "You wouldn't steal a car!") and threats of potential legal action.

### Wave One: File-sharing Services (decentralized)
// Edit: centralized but general purpose?

Decentralized services (here used as "multiplicity of platforms with the same function") displaced the problems of on-demand availability through the network-attached storage, provided by the service operators. Now, files for distribution only had to be uploaded once from the user who was still limited by the internet providers upload capacity. The user transfers the responsibility and the management of availability (always-on or promise) to the service who would handle all the download traffic from all downloading users.

// "single point of failure" or "self-regulation"


- Rapidshare (May, 2002)
- YouSendIt (Early 2004)
- Megaupload (Mar, 2005)
- Mediafire ("Unlimited Upload", Jun 2006)
- GigaSize ("1,5GB Uploads", Aug 2006)
- FilesTube ("Search for Uploaded Files", Jun 2007)
- Zippyshare ("500MB Uploads", 2006 / Sep 2007*)
- Hotfile ("400MB Uploads", Mar 2009)
- Fileserve (Apr 2010*)

![Wave Two](../assets/file-sharing.png)


The scale of users and the costs for available storage forced service providers to limit the amounts of possible downloads or the speed of download bandwidth to implement freemium business models, where the premium users would pay for the actual costs of hosting in favor of immediate, unlimited and simultaneous downloads – regaining all of the "benefits" of the original P2P vision / version.
For the users, the browser was the only tool needed and (temporary) download links could be shared easily in forums, chats or could be found with Google search queries. "One-click file hosting" didn't require specific technical knowledge and was more convenient and accessible for end-users. After downloading the file, the management of the music library on the local file system is still in the hands of the user and had to be done mostly by hand for each download.

### Wave Two: Apple, Trust and the Music Industry (centralized)
// Edit: centralized and specific purpose (+ community)?

Apple is probably the most influential player in the formation of centralized control mechanisms of todays mobile devices with their take on integrated software and hardware solutions. They function as the trust-giving authority to the music industry that heavily fought against the distribution of digital music files.
Apple's integration process started with the acquisition of SoundJam MP (1998) in the year 2000, which was a MacOS 8 and 9 compatible MP3 player that was reengineered, rebranded as iTunes and used as default music player in MacOS since then.
This strategic move led to the separation of the file's location in the file system and the application interface, which acts now as a medium specific file organization tool that was not provided by the general purpose file-explorer "Finder". The user has to conform to this closed system, their structural implications and limited customization or personalization because it is all handled by the software to make the process of file management nearly invisible and "easy to use".


These  application dependent files were managed and prepared to be then one-way synced with proprietary, specific purpose hardware – the iPod. And so was the ecosystem growing and integrated.

Apple is bootstrapping from the music libraries from P2P file-sharing and ripping CDs



> "The Mac can become the "digital hub" of our emerging digital lifestyle, adding tremendous value to our other digital devices."

> "We realized that Apple is uniquely suited to do this because we are the last company in this business that has all these components [Hardware, Operating System, Application, Internet, Marketing] under one roof."  

> "So what are we gonna focus on next? Audio. There is a music revolution happening right now. That music revolution is digital music on computers. So for those of you who are not participating in this, let me describe it to you: you want to rip your audio CDs on your computer disk. (...) The format of choice is MP3, it is a very dense format, very high quality and it's open. And then it allows you to create playlists from your favorite songs (...) rearrange the order and listen to them in any order i want. the music compiled the way I want and not the way some record company wants."

– Jobs, Macworld SF 2001

"Burn your playlists on your custom CDs"
"All-in-one integrated application"

Apple then became general purpose again with the iPhone 3G (2008) with the App Store (making iOS app development available as platform) which inherits the same control mechanisms of filesystem abstraction

- file management in filesystem to application-based management in iTunes  
- iPods used a closed, one-way syncing system. This concept would increased the trust of the music labels to tap into the digital realm. This one-way mechanism prevented the possibility of device-to-device file-sharing

while the industry is fighting everyone who makes file-sharing available
through networks or services apple uses its highly controlled and centralized music application and extends it with a market with the cooperation of five major labels.   
- with the introduction of the iTunes Store (2003) songs were copy-protected with DRM (Digital Rights Management), which was the perfect vendor lock-in, because it prevented music to be on non-Apple devices




- company shifts from general purpose hardware (PCs) to media distribution as a service + media specific handheld hardware to media and application distribution as a service + general(?) purpose handheld hardware
- the mobile devices are not self-sustaining (for now), but their initial syncing bridge could be dropped due to over-the-air updates which don't require a computer to install.



> "How can the PC add such value? Why? Well, for a few reasons. One, because it can run complex applications, these devices can't. They don't have enough horsepower. Two, because the PC's got a big screen on it. That doesn't mean that you can just see more information, we can make much better user-interfaces. Most of these digital devices have pretty brain-dead UIs. We can burn disks as we have seen CDs and now DVDs. The digital devices can't do that. And we got large, inexpensive storage. You pay a fortune for those flashcards for your camera (...)."


### Wave Three: Streaming Services & Demonetization (vertical)
streaming services made file-sharing almost unnecessary for mainstream music, "all in one place", easy to navigate, no individual payments for a song, easy to mange, personal playlists, shared playlists
- file management through platform
also changes of industry through publishing on Soundcloud e.g.
- artists want their music to be "free" and used to generate network effects to indirect earn money through other forms of products (events, premium content, etc.)
