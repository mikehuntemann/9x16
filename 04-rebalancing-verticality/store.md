Why wasn't email interrupted by innovation? Mostly because it is a protocol that is not owned by anyone, is hard to change and is therefore a stable communication medium for everyone.



We won't get rid of verticals, but we can change their capacities, reduce their extend of influence.
extend the entity-based machine layer, reduce the extend of platform-owned identities. The hierarchies will still exist, but to a lower degree. hyperlinks subvert hierarchies! identity as to be build application-specific now, "account", "user" of each service.

and why TikTok may be excluded > too software / network-specific and fast paced? > why even archive?

There will be centralized services over all, but only for high-end purposes that need more efficiency or extremely low latency.

The innovation has now come from the most basic infrastructures, and it is going to be developed on open source platforms or operating systems first, because it is the most appropriate layer for integration in combination with the browser. (?)

only with payment comes expectations, rights and privileges (voice), we expect things to be free on the internet > consumer problem

Applications and services have already split their storage to more efficient silos like AWS S3, so their core business logic is not affected by a decentralized file-based data storage.

Encrypting the backup doesn’t work! > this is the “real” monopolization through the cooperation and compliance with state authorities.
When splitting facebook up into their functional and infrastructural layers, we can dissect the newsfeed from other functions. This can be seen as a tool of content curation, or specific network production, I see no problem in “community protecting” censorship mechanisms as long it is not the single source of information retrieval. Facebook should not be the only host.
When a “post” or a “tweet” would be self-describing, other communities can form around user generated content, a multiplication of curators (as a service), having their own guidelines, values and “appropriate” contents. Mastadon is trying this with a federated copy of twitter, and can also be seen in community management within live-streams or discord channels. This way you get community-based self-regulation, more specific and less violent, than having facebook and its associates as authorities for the “speakable”. Reddit makes this point a bit clearer, because it is partly a content aggregator for content discovery on the internet in general, and has way less “network integrated production” than others. But this might also change over time.  



## The Hosting Problem

http used location based addressing > domain to ip
centralized location = single point of failure
404 Error - Not found



hosting & identity need to be application / platform independent
> need for digital money aka bitcoin
> further atomization of content
> markets / economic incentives to provide decentralized / autonomous infrastructure

email is very stable because there is not one company in charge. you can be an access point, due to hosing and domain registration, but except from that, it is one of the most stable mediums we have seen for now.

Too many problems that can't be solved now, and not by activism on its own.
it is voice vs exit. My take is to understand the "physics", or the mechanisms below to look at the infrastructure that creates these symptoms and not trying to solve the symptoms we are confronted with on a daily basis.  


## The Roadmap




Enabling the distributed web
https://medium.com/textileio/enabling-the-distributed-web-abf7ab33b638
Whoever controls the location serves what the people are going to see.

Websites became less important on mobile, instead we get these little packages of pre-structured data that fill the design preset within the app, e.g. a tweet, or a post. > and this is all json, a data format which is commonly used within server-client communication.

Most of the internet dies within a 100 days, except the seemingly stable internet platforms.

This whole process abstracts the filesystem from the user.
“We traded convenience for control.”

Content addressing changes the “where” to “what”.
So how does it work? You create a unique, content-based fingerprint of your file. And this concept isn’t new. I used it as a child, 15 years ago, while I was participating in peer-to-peer file sharing.
Different protocol now but functions similar: you ask the network for the content ID and the network will find other people that have that identical piece of content. Now, you are downloading the file from multiple people in parallel instead of one single distributor of the content and authority.

peer-to-peer is inevitable because it will be the most cost-efficient variant of information exchange:
p2p: costs = (filesize / customer) x cost-per-byte
CDNs: costs = filesize x customer x cost-per-byte   

But there will be hybrids for sure.


CIDs are stable and don’t change over time. (Persistent data structure https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure)

1 picture to chunks of raw data, which get through a hash function, which then turn into a collection of CIDs that are then hashed together for the “base CID”, which is the file with all of its components.

You can also link your data (IPLD)
DAGs are simple link-based graphs > like a tree, a erected acyclic graph (like my knowledge graph)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph

Every 12 hours you have to tell the network, that you can provide the CID or you are out of the peer list

## timeless media

Time expansion > short productions in cycles, series
Time compression > production for one, self-describing piece.

Or the hybrid because of the fast speed:
Production of shorter products which are self-describing but modular
> the curation of our own products > atomization
> the continuous search, the bigger underlying theme, your values and personal interest
