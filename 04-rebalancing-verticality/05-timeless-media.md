### "Timeless Media"?

> “Signals that are not repeated or repeatable 'die'.”
– Wendy Chun (Updating the Remain the Same: Habitual New Media) p. 52

How do we get the notion of “timelessness” into our practice? When in the past New Media always died first, what do we have to change in order to persist time or to (partially) remain?

This is fragmentation, atomization. Make it useful and reusable, referential for your peers and your future self, by default.

We are already creating bodies of work, but more in terms of “physically scarce” or “information scarce”, therefore making things difficult to recreate, instead of “information abundant”. This is the next step.

A composer uses the framework of musical notation. Which is the abstraction or codification of music instruments in general and the sounds which can be performed with each instrument.

Their work is not "original" to its core. Only the sequences and combinatorics on the layer above. They are creating patterns.

> „Musical notation serves as a set of directions for a performer, but there is a whole continuum of possibilities concerning how much the performer determines the final form of the rendered work in performance.“ [Composers and performers (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composer#Composers_and_performers)

All this research leads to an outcry for reconfiguration, a reboot.
We cannot go forward without some lessons we can take from that important step in the development of technology. You don’t have to be a fan of these existing platforms today, but you can acknowledge the experiments and learnings made along the way.

You wouldn’t have done a better job as a Zuckerberg or a Dorsey. It is part of the game. It is bootstrapping. This is evolution at its best. Time to kill the ill branch and start a new branch with a fresh new stack of underlying infrastructure.

From there, we can architect, compose, create new constructs and then we design within that new framework.

And this practice I see as the only real solution to keep up with the exponential pace of technology in general:
Sharing sources and templates, approaches and learnings.
Ultimately, to never do the same thing twice and keep on learning.
