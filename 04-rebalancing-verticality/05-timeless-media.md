### "Timeless Media"?

> “Signals that are not repeated or repeatable 'die'.”
– Wendy Chun (Updating the Remain the Same: Habitual New Media) p. 52

In the end, I want to ask: How do we get the notion of “timelessness” into our practice? When in the past new media always died first, what do we have to change or focus on in order to persist time or to (partially) remain?

And the key to that is fragmentation, atomization. To make it useful and reusable, referential for your peers and your future self, by default.

We are already creating bodies of work, but more in terms of “physically scarce” or “information scarce”, therefore making things difficult to recreate, instead of “information abundant”. This is the next step.

As an analogy, we can look at the work of a musical composer as a knowledge worker and how they are shaping an information architecture might be helpful to make the point.
A composer uses the framework of musical notation. Which is the abstraction or codification of music instruments in general and the sounds which can be performed with each instrument.

Their work is not "original" to its core. Only the sequences and combinatorics on the layer above. They are primarily creating new or amplifying existing patterns. And they might become timeless, they will exist longer than the work as a whole.

> „Musical notation serves as a set of directions for a performer, but there is a whole continuum of possibilities concerning how much the performer determines the final form of the rendered work in performance.“ [Composers and performers (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composer#Composers_and_performers)

And this is where I see the similarities to my works in the past, as well as the connection to the vision of the proposed framework. I use available sources, found footage, user-created content, public data.
I sense patterns, I compare and re-contextualize, I do montages or sequences. I orchestrate existing content. This is what I do. I am performing the content with my computer.    
All this research leads to an outcry for reconfiguration, a reboot, how to approach and work with the material.

With the introduction of this new underlying paradigm of how the internet can work, I want to reflect upon the current, predominant mode.
We cannot go forward without some lessons we can take from that important step in the development of technology. You don’t have to be a fan of these existing platforms today, but you can acknowledge the experiments and learnings made along the way. We need these experiments and we need the resulting crisis they are causing.

Personally, I wouldn’t have done a better job as a Zuckerberg or a Dorsey. This is part of the game. It is bootstrapping. This is evolution at its best. This is how you navigate uncertainty, you make experiments. And this is how I like to see them. Not static, unshakable structures, but a necessary, temporary state, to figure out what might be useful.

But now it is time to leave behind the ill branch and start a new branch with a fresh new stack of underlying infrastructure.
From there, we can rebuild, architect, compose, create new constructs and then we design within that new framework.

And this practice I see as the only real solution to keep up with the exponential pace of technology in general:
Reduce your "machine distance" – stop being just an end-user.
Or as [Naval Ravikant pointed out](https://youtu.be/kvGFldxwjhY?t=135): become digital literate and know how to be good with computers.

Share your sources and references, templates and approaches.
Ultimately, to never do the same thing twice and keep on learning and exploring.
