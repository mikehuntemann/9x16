## The Hosting Problem

The corporate database, the data silo and the single point of access and failure is the invention of Oracle in the 1970s. They were marketing the protection of the companies data as "valuable data-assets". Since then – and we see the results of that branch of iterating upon that idea – the companies became highly database-centric.

As [Bob Martin points out](https://youtu.be/o_TH-Y78tt4?t=2566), the argument for the database itself is persistence – we want things to remain. But he argues that we had persistence long before the invention of the database. And that is in the UNIX-style directory structure.   
He emphasizes, that the "database" should be a detail and not the primary, architecture defining premise.

So what will change in a decentralized, distributed web, how can this possibly work and who is able to build it anyway?

> “Any organization that designs a system will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.” - Conway's Law (1967)

This means that institutions and companies today will always replicate themselves in their services, as long as there will be a new constellation and formation of cooperation: decentralized organizations will naturally lead to decentralized services, focussing on modularity and interoperability.

Or as Michael Hammer explains it in "Reengineering the Corporation (1993)": Product innovation needs also an innovation in the process of creating them.

And the invention of Bitcoin leads by example:

>"A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990's. I hope it's obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system." - Satoshi Nakamoto

But this is not only true for Bitcoin, this is also true for any kind of Open Source development and was already perfectly demonstrated by the developments of the Linux Kernel and the process innovation that was necessary after the project reached a certain scale. This triggered the development of Git for remote and asynchronous collaboration on the source code. And we also have to keep in mind, that all of these companies are build upon and with Open Source software in the first place.

Back to decentralization. Instead of giving companies the ability to become a central authority we can create or use protocols that restrict the same companies the "ownership of data-assets" that should ultimately belong to the sovereign individual and therefore minimizes the trust you have to give a company as a "user" and maximize trust, stability and persistence into the underlying protocol itself.

Today it is not possible to verify what the Facebooks and the Googles are actually doing with the data in their systems. In the future, there will be as a result of this new paradigm of encryption-based protocols.

>“We can not solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them.” –Albert Einstein

Or in this case: you can not solve the problems with the same stack of technologies that created them. When the flaws (loss of privacy, mass-surveillance, anti-trust, etc.) of today's internet are that fundamental, we won't solve them by iteration ("self-regulation" by companies) or legislation (regulation by nation states). The flaws are all symptoms of the underlying structure. So the shift has to come from the bottom up, integrated and adopted step by step, bit by bit.

How can for example the decentralized Bitcoin network – as one of the first ambassadors of this technological shift – fail?

> "The only way Bitcoin fails is from the inside. It has to fail because of a critical vulnerability that can not be fixed or that people don’t want to fix. It has to fail because of a failure of community, trust or culture. And that is very difficult to do with a technology that has so many participants, who have so many different motivations, different cultures, different languages, different operating systems, different software platforms, all collaborating around one core basic set of ideas. They have all be disappointed for different reasons, simultaneously.” – [Andreas M. Antonopoulos](https://youtu.be/p0ftZgCEZos?t=1837)

But the same thing is true for Facebook and any other massive network or platform. Direct competition is not the way to go. You can not compete under the same "technical conditions" with companies that are employing almost all of the most capable programmers. Especially not in an environment that is driven by exponential growth and network effects.
They can only fail by their own creations and actions, the loss of trust and a cultural or technological shift.

It is all a matter of ["bundling and unbundling"](https://web.archive.org/web/20190904214835/https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling), bundled music albums became unbundled songs and re-bundled into a playlist. The same will be true for verticality into modularity.

And if everything is naturally a cycle, then all empires must fall eventually, because history is repeating itself. They are waves.
