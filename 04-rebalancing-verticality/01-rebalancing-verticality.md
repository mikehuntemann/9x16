Rebalancing Verticality
=======================

So now you probably ask: How do both paths or branches of this research come together and what is the consequence or the result of that?  
After exploring both the micro and the macro of research, the specific research subjects and the process of doing the research itself, I see two major problems, which I call "the hosting problem" and "the referencing problem".

The hosting problem is a critique of the "location" of (centralized) data and who is in actually in charge of preserving the information and the referencing problem is the direct result of these techniques and information technologies.

When we look at any of the previously mentioned mobile-first networks, we see a vertical stack of influence and control:
- the identity management of user accounts
- the interface or application (which includes the content production)
- the content curation system (the way content gets distributed within the network)
- the hosting of the files (which are easy to get in but partly restricted or limited to get them out)

And here we can see the value those companies add to the way how they manage data at scale. The databases in itself are "knowledge-graphs" and therefore consist of fragmented but specifically standardized and pre-structured, multi-directional data points, while the rest of the web has to rely on links that are only one-directional â€“ pointing to the location of where the content might live.

**And this is were this whole construct breaks. The internet needs a different way to link, host and distribute the data.** And this paradigm shift is what we will experience in the transition to the Web 3.0: splitting the hosting from the services in combination with default encryption on this base-layer.
But before that, where did this architecture come from in the first place?
