## The Move to the Ocean

A principle I have been following in my past projects:  

Grab the project recipe.
Download all of the necessary content from the network.
Perform the recipe (now within the browser).

The result of this information architecture will be some form of "responsive performance". Designs can be defined relative in terms of its aspect ratios and sizes, we have already seen it in the evolution of responsive websites. The missing part of this framework is only: how to handle the timing of each content? That's it. That is the only piece missing in the puzzle.

This way, you can implement files into your project and become part of preserving the data over time. Or, if I find something valuable on the web or for example in my prototype for media archeology, collaborators or other people can help to keep the project itself, or maybe only assets of it, alive.

In the end, we don't need local storage, final exports, finished products or huge databases as a single point of authority or failure to mange and distribute the data. We can help each other and do this collectively.

There will be files that will organically spread across the web and others you have to hold for your own, maybe because it is not the right time for it, yet.
