# Bootstrapping

Through the lense of bootstrapping you can get a grasp on how technologies somehow lead naturally to the next idea. IMHO, there is a difference between "disrupitve" innovation (implies a paradigm shift on a deeper infrastructural level) and iteration as an alteration of applications build upon the same infrastructural level which tends to be a more efficient version of the status quo.

In the following I will try to outline the different bootstrapping approaches of the companies and services that more or less surround us on a daily basis.

**Facebook (2004)** is bootstrapping from already verified university email addresses. Only with the existing work of authorization through the universities it was possible to build the base for an "autheniticity" based social network.


**Reddit (2005)** is bootstrapping from the early newsgroups and forums which were often topic dependent, Reddit generalized this concept.


**Amazon AWS (2006)** is bootstrapping from the "general purpose" hardware stack and combined it into one easy-to-use, subscription-based service. Every service had to run on its own servers, not anymore. 


**YouTube (2006)** is bootstrapping from video-capable digital cameras, which already were in use but didn't had "free" storage on the internet to be shared publicly and similar media sharing and community platforms like **Flickr (2004)**, which is based on photography.
(free, public-facing hosting)


**Twitter (2006)** is bootstrapping from SMS text-messages to make group chats possible and evoled quickly into a service to comment on live events.


**Instagram (2010)** is bootstrapping from the Facebook Platform integration for making an account and sharing to the FB friendslist. In addition to that, they use the hardware and software capabilities for photo production and editing that are coming with the iPhone.

**Vine (2012)** is bootstrapping from Instagram, basically worked as an exact design clone with the focus on square videos instead of photos.
It also has integrated perfectly with the Twitter feed.

**Snapchat (2011)** and **Whatsapp (2009)** are both bootstrapping from the smartphone's contacts to function as "close-friends" network. Snapchat especially focuses, like instagram, on the iPhones photo production and editing capabilities.


**TikTok (2017)** as well as **Musical.ly (2014)** are bootstrapping from viral videos that are a side effect of all previous "general purpose" social media platforms. In addition, they both profit from already centralized music platforms such as **Spotify (2006)** which made music royalty payments easier.

**Google (1998)** is bootstrapping from the internets native hyperlink for its algorithmic curation and publicly accessable content.


The internet (ARPANET: 1969) itself is bootstrapping from the telephone lines.

> "[Bootstrapping] is the process of starting a computer, specifically with regard to starting its software. The process involves a chain of stages, in which at each stage a smaller, simpler program loads and then executes the larger, more complicated program of the next stage. It is in this sense that the computer "pulls itself up by its bootstraps", i.e. it improves itself by its own efforts."
