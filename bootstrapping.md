# Bootstrapping
"This is the "Construct". It's our loading program. We can load anything, from clothing to equipment, weapons, training simulations, anything we need." - Morpheus, The Matrix (1999)

The Matrix's "Construct" represents a white, endless space which can be filled or modified with all kinds of objects. But it is not without references. The appearing objects are things we already know - things we are familiar with - ideas that already existed outside of the "Construct". They are legacy, historical artifacts, bound or specifically shaped by the physics that exists in the "real world" as well as the simulated world within the empty space.

We can compare this scene in the movie with the emergence of "new" technologies. Technologies inhabit references of preexisting structures, patterns that are repeated and replicated, iterated and extended. 

To make a more visual example, let's look at the initial software design of the iPhone and the intersection of software, hardware and the expectation of the user to interact with this device – the interface. 
The iPhone's interface could have been completely different. The screen was just an array of pixels that is able to potentially display any kind of images. A white space, a construct of its own.
But what the designers of the iPhone – as a combination of different technologies into a "new" unified product - did was presenting the users a surface they already knew, internally, intuitively. 
This mechanism is called skeumorphism, which memes textures from the physical environment into the digital frame, that therefore signals the sense of familiarity and orientation.

This pattern is what i call *bootstrapping*: building on top of already known ideas and structures to build more complex structures. You don't have to invent the basic Lego brick each time you want to build something, once it is there, you can just stack them into all kinds of forms. 
But these modular frameworks limit your possibilites of building as well as thinking. In the moment you submit to the idea of the Lego framework you are bound to the underlying principles and resolution of how to build things: frameworks suppress ideas that are not compatible this existing modules. The same princple works for software and hardware.

Through the lense of bootstrapping you can get a grasp on how technologies somehow lead naturally to the next idea. IMHO, there is a difference between "disrupitve" innovation (implies a paradigm shift on a deeper infrastructural level) and iteration as an alteration of applications build upon the same infrastructural level which tends to be a more efficient version of the status quo.

In the following I will try to outline the different bootstrapping approaches of the companies and internet platforms that more or less surround us on a daily basis.


The **Internet (1969)** itself is bootstrapping from the telephone lines. This idea repurposes existing application-dependent infrastructure ("making a phone-call") to a general purpose, application-independent infrastructure ("sending information").    

**Google (1998)** is bootstrapping from the internets native hyperlink  and publicly accessable content for its algorithmic indexing curation.


**Facebook (2004)** is bootstrapping from already verified university email addresses. Only with the existing work of authorization through the universities it was possible to build the base for an "autheniticity" based social network.


**Reddit (2005)** is bootstrapping from the early newsgroups and forums which were often topic dependent, Reddit generalized this concept.


**Amazon AWS (2006)** is bootstrapping from the "general purpose" hardware stack and combined it into one easy-to-use, subscription-based service. Every service had to run on its own servers, not anymore. 


**YouTube (2006)** is bootstrapping from video-capable digital cameras, which already were in use but didn't had "free" storage on the internet to be shared publicly and similar media sharing and community platforms like **Flickr (2004)**, which is based on photography.
// free, public-facing hosting


**Twitter (2006)** is bootstrapping from SMS text-messages to make group chats possible and evoled quickly into a service to comment on live events.


**Instagram (2010)** is bootstrapping from the Facebook Platform integration for making an account and sharing to the FB friendslist. In addition to that, they use the hardware and software capabilities for photo production and editing that are coming with the iPhone.

**Vine (2012)** is bootstrapping from Instagram, basically worked as an exact design clone with the focus on square videos instead of photos. It also has integrated perfectly with Twitter's news feed.

**Snapchat (2011)** and **Whatsapp (2009)** are both bootstrapping from the smartphone's contacts to function as "close-friends" network. Snapchat especially focuses, like instagram, on the iPhones photo production and editing capabilities.


**TikTok (2017)** as well as **Musical.ly (2014)** are bootstrapping from viral videos that are a side effect of all previous "general purpose" social media platforms. In addition, they both profit from already centralized music platforms such as **Spotify (2006)** which made music royalty payments easier.


This list could go on forever, but it should be enough to see some of the the evolutionary patterns. We can further generalize the greater shifts within the platformization in the era of the **Web 2.0**:

### 2004 - 2006
- Social / Scale / Storage 
- Building Hardware Infrastructure
- application-based (desktop) to web-based (browser, ajax)

### 2010 - 2013
- Mobile Devices / Image Production / AWS Bootstrapping
- Renting Hardware Infrastructure
- web-based (browser) to application-based (mobile)

> "[Bootstrapping] is the process of starting a computer, specifically with regard to starting its software. The process involves a chain of stages, in which at each stage a smaller, simpler program loads and then executes the larger, more complicated program of the next stage. It is in this sense that the computer "pulls itself up by its bootstraps", i.e. it improves itself by its own efforts."
