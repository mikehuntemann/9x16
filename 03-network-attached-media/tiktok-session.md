#TikTok Takeover

TikTok is a weird creature.
Before being merged together, TikTok was a 1:1 clone of Musically (2014) which was meant to perform and record lip-sync videos within the mobile device. It integrated music samples from their service which no other app was capabale of at that time. The app took of with the #dontjudgechallenge which appeared 2015 as a reaction to a YouTube video "You are disgusting", which then became viral on several social media sites. The three most used apps for this challenge were Vine, Flipagram and Musically itself. Vine could only solve the mobile-only image editing while having only recorded audio from the phones microphone, Flipagram let you compose videos to the music library you had on your phone and Musically provided their music library to the user-base to which you could perform, making the selection of songs more available and frictionless.

After Musically solved the initial problem of cropped videos – they were 9x16 natively, but the shared platforms were back then still focusing on the 1:1, square format, they repositioned their branding to the center after each clip – which got them #1 in the app store shortly after.
A few years later, TikTok emerges in the western culture, giving the app a different spin. It included more advanced in-app editing capabilites, mostly a combination of video filters and augmented reality features. With that, the focus was not only the performance to music, but content that would "challenge" the user to (re-)produce a certain editing style and performance to a specific music. TikTok works as a Meme-Machine. And it is better than language. 

With over 1B downloads today, TikTok reaches an international audience, mobilizing masses to contribute to ongoing challenges. In terms of the performance-based characteristics, TikTok seems as the "end-game" to what is the most engaging, most entertaining and easiest to (re-)produce app on the market today.

An interesting shift can be seen within the app. Compared to Facebook and Instagram, were all the content is highly identity- or brand-based, TikTok makes the Challenges itself to the epicenter. It is an event, a happening, trying to get you active and participate. (In this sense, it is maybe more related to Twitter than anything else.) With that, each of the content creators become the transport layer of an idea, which seem to create either a copy of existing patterns, iterations upon existing content or a pattern breaking anti-gerne, which resists to conform to the users expectation or micro viewing habit (for each challenge or "branch" of challenges). 

The musical rhythm becomes the recipie and driving force for the recording and editing process.
The memes are music-driven. It sets the mood and directs the pace. In my research I found that this music can be identified as "plot twist" music, separating the 15 second soundtrack often into two phases: problem / solution, before / after or other "binary states" or sequences.

a supprise element, playing with the expectations of previously seen footage, this type of media creates the necessity of creating even funnier versions and alterations. 

The music supports this plot twisting even by their initial structure itself, for example by an uplifting build into a bass-drop or by further editing the music by heavily overused bass-amplifiers or other editing techniques. sometimes both in combination to more extreme versions. Those kind of sound are often user uploads originating from soundcloud or bass-boosted versions from youtube. If that is the case, the users name is referenced as the "origianl" uploader of the song. In other cases, the platform-provided sound features the original musician and title at the bottom.


All assets that are used (music and filters) are transparent and available in the interface, giving each user the same possibilities of creation. This can be seen as an evolution and increased capability of the instagram filters which were encoded into the image as such, hiding its references.  

With this "openness", we can see "micro-creativity" at it's best. An atomized, democratized way of producing, bundled with a platform-specific referencing system that 


In my case-study i investigated the #karmaisabitchchallenge that got viral within the chinese version of tiktok in early 2018, which then got cross-platform viral and internationally known after more and more people picked it up and reported on it.  



- Virality: The You as Transport Layer and the Survival of the Idea itself.
- "Original" vs "Immitation" vs "Iteration" 

- Reference System
- "Sharing" Assets
- Media-Internal Referencing / Reactions + Multi-Reactions

in-media reactions + references / "media-chaining"
group identity, peer-production


TikTok is not trying to meaningful, it is highly playful. A emotionally-driven, collective experience – on the smartphone. 

What twitter is for expressing and iterating [not cognitive but similar] ideas, tiktok is for expressing and iterating on performances and expectations.
