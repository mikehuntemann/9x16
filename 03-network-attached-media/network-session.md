what does the network want? session

The internet has another fundamental problem: monetization. Most social media platforms that survived the initial start-up and venture capital phase have an ad-centric business model. The inital narration is always: scale the community, then introduce ads to generate revenue and support (full-time) content creators to continue and create a media business. 
The ad business model is conntected to the "time-on-site" metric. The more time you spend on the platform, the more ads you will see, the more money will be generated in the background.
But this gives the network a "perverse incentive" that can cause (un)intentional consequences.
But in terms of the business model and "user-engagement" I think the companies see it as a natural fit or process of merging marketing metrics, brand affiliations and content production, so I would say it is intentional. And why wouldn't they? They are just "sensing" what the creators and the users want and iterate upon that.

This combination leads to habituation (or addiction), by recurring visits to the platform and to certain creators that integrate the companies (and therefore the algorithms) incentives into their media production.

With this came the emergence of the "social video" or "community-driven videos", as Facebook calls it.

> "the experience of watching a video on facebook should be inextricable  from sharing or discussing it" > live video with streams of comments, seamless integration of chatting with friends (you can also invite) and discuss further in messenger, public conversation or private, with friends

> "ultimately, our goal is to make the video experience on facebook more social and to build more intention and habit around video"
what does it mean for publishers and creators with facebook audiences?
community will be the core of video that it affects the content in itself. new content formats and best practices are emerging in this world of community-driven video 

shared videos from friends are watched 40% longer, live videos with friends result in longer watch times, "communal watching" amplifies the experience of watching resulting in more emotional responses


So Facebook incentivized producers and creators to "pivot to video" just by tweeking the algorithm to distribute this format more prominently by supressing other forms.

  when videos are getting performance-based, the produces get feedback on their "fitness". this heavily relies on the algorithmic distribution system that filters the content. This is the "curration problem", scarce screen space and time, abundant content.







facebook wants to integrate everything
"organic reach" as bandwidth limitation, "relevant content"
native always wins: youtube videos got replaced step-by-step by facebook video

facebook algo changes > "pivot to video" (2015), media companies cutting staff for written content, because short-form video "works better"
in addition to that, the metric for "views" itself was flawed. after an update, playbacks under 3 seconds weren't counted as views, leading to 60-80% drops in view-related metrics.


paddle back, de-emphasizing videos again, promoting videos with higher production value
- fighting viral videos, instead "meaningful, high quality engegement"

> "With this update, we will also prioritize posts that spark conversations and meaningful interactions between people. To do this, we will predict which posts you might want to interact with your friends about, and show these posts higher in feed. These are posts that inspire back-and-forth discussion in the comments and posts that you might want to share and react to – whether that’s a post from a friend seeking advice, a friend asking for recommendations for a trip, or a news article or video prompting lots of discussion."

youtube suppresses the recommendation content that is not suited to be used for ad rolls.
youtube score also rates your "production value"

instagram closes api to keep users within the platform, instagram has the highest engegement rates of every social media platform
instagram copies stories feature to stop snapchat growth, it is just a feature so it can be copied but the different culture on snapchat can't be copied.


aggregator news feeds dont work with video: they are silent and mute sound on playback. this itself shapes the content, resulting in more and more subtitled videos. The context always forms the visual. This is how the invisible shapes the visible. 

live video (fb) results in 6x engagement

the future of video on facebook

newsfeed is for discovery "just browsing", it is passive and unintetional 
"community-driven video"
"shows that give us something to talk about"
"videos are a shared experience" > tv shows



videos build around a group of common interest > fanbase of HBO series

we fundamentally belive, that video doesn't have to be a passive experience
polls, challenges


igtv as a result for creator feedback that the 15 sec cap is a problem
problem of cross-platform community building > you can not transfer your views to another platform so you need tools within the platform

different communities on different platforms 
igtv + facebook watch to cross-post to both platforms to monetize
igtv is bootstrapped from facebooks watch platform (only 6 month development time) they could just plug-in

a minute for video in feeds is "long", because feed is for discovery
igtv app is intentional long-format 

facebook watch is focusing on habitual viewing experience that brings you back and creating this loyalty with the content creators, pages get favored if they have the property of bringing people back to the platform 

content as catalyst of community discussion without the creator, fans talking to eachother 

> "the key is always: start with great content. Number one is actually know your audience and use your insights to understand which content is resonating and we are clearly rewarding content that brings people back, which creates this loyalty." > "then nurture your community with live as the best tool (...) and the groups extent the presents of the creator without actually engaging because the fans make the stories for you."


big audience = revenue share of ad breaks
niche audience = direct funding from "super fans"
branded content = plaform to get brand and creators connected via target audience and "mutual interest"
