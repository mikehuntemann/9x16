what does the network want? session

The internet has another fundamental problem: monetization. Most social media platforms that survived the initial start-up and venture capital phase have an ad-centric business model or were merged into one. The inital narration is always: scale the community, then introduce ads to generate revenue and support (full-time) content creators to continue and create a media business. 
The ad business model is conntected to the "time-on-site" metric. The more time you spend on the platform, the more ads you will see, the more money will be generated in the background.
But this gives the network a "perverse incentive" that can cause unintentional consequences.
But in terms of the business model and "user-engagement" I think the companies see it as a natural fit or process of merging marketing metrics, brand affiliations and content production, so I would say it is intentional. And why wouldn't they? They are just "sensing" what the creators and the users want and iterate upon that. This is what Chamath Palihapitiya calls ["not a Facebook problem"][1] but a consumer problem, because users ["have grown addicted to things that are free (...) it's just no expectation [to pay for things on the internet]."

This fundamental framework leads to habituation (or in its extreme form to addiction), by recurring visits to the platform and to certain creators that integrate the companies (and therefore the algorithms) incentives into their media production, which reinforces the expectations of the distribution system and therefore the expectation of the audience.

With this focus on engagement came the emergence of the "social video" or "community-driven videos", as Facebook calls it.

> "We are trying to imagine ways to make the experience of watching a video on Facebook inextricable from the experience of sharing or discussing it." – [Daniel Danker (Product Management Director, Facebook)][2]

Here it is useful to note that Facebook still separates audience from content creator. This paradigm blures with the concept of TikTok, but I will get into that in the "TikTok Takeover" chapter. 

With Live Video as an example for maximum platform engagement, it sets the bar for seamless integration of interaction within a broadcast, resulting in streams of public comments or private chatting with friends (you can also invite) and discuss further in Messenger. 

What Facebook is creating are more platform dependencies, guiding / funneling reactions, responses and discussions back into the vertical system.

Ultimately, Facebook wants to integrate everything, therefore content has to be Facebook specific because "native always wins" in terms of efficency and user experience. An interesting example here is the step-by-step reduction of YouTube videos out of the News Feed. YouTube videos show up half as much as native Facebook videos. Not only this, but in addition to that the YouTube video has a less preferencial News Feed integration and previews, for example the missing autoplay feature which creates more friction in the playing process (extended "time-to-play").

> "ultimately, our goal is to make the video experience on facebook more social and to build more intention and habit around video"
what does it mean for publishers and creators with facebook audiences?
community will be the core of video that it affects the content in itself. new content formats and best practices are emerging in this world of community-driven video." 

shared videos from friends are watched 40% longer, live videos with friends result in longer watch times, "communal watching" amplifies the experience of watching resulting in more emotional responses


> "The key is always: start with great content. Number one is actually know your audience and use your insights to understand which content is resonating and (...) we are clearly rewarding content that brings people back, which creates this loyalty. (...) And then it's really about nurturing it and for that I would say that Live remains as the best tool we have (...) and then we are seeing that Groups is actually a way to extent your presence as a creator beyond the times were you are actually  directly engaging because the fans make the stories for you."
– [Fidji Simo][3]

content as catalyst for engagement, creating the platform lock-in. Why do we have to have the discussion within facebook? > your reaction can be measured, quantified and you don't get interrupted by other stuff that isn't on facebook (e.g. the real world).



### what happens when the distribution system changes?

"organic reach" as bandwidth limitation, definitions of what is "relevant content" changes (values, trajectory, "mission“)


So Facebook incentivized producers and creators to "pivot to video" just by tweeking the algorithm to distribute this format more prominently (video as predominant form of communication) by supressing other forms. 

when videos are getting performance-based, the produces get feedback on their "fitness". this heavily relies on the algorithmic distribution system that filters the content. This is the "curration problem", scarce screen space and time, abundant content.

youtube example, intransparent indicators > should prevent "gaming the system" > can be updated anytime > not stable, unpredictable 

what could go wrong? > "russian interference", cambrdige analytica
not a bug, it's a feature: targeting and persuation, just marketing!

facebook algo changes > "pivot to video" (2015), media companies cutting staff for written content, because short-form video "works better"
in addition to that, the metric for "views" itself was flawed. after an update, playbacks under 3 seconds weren't counted as views, leading to 60-80% drops in view-related metrics.

3 sec (Facebook) vs 30 sec (YouTube) as a measurement of one view.



pivot to meaningful

paddle back, de-emphasizing videos again, promoting videos with higher production value
- fighting viral videos, instead "meaningful, high quality engegement"

> "With this update, we will also prioritize posts that spark conversations and meaningful interactions between people. To do this, we will predict which posts you might want to interact with your friends about, and show these posts higher in feed. These are posts that inspire back-and-forth discussion in the comments and posts that you might want to share and react to – whether that’s a post from a friend seeking advice, a friend asking for recommendations for a trip, or a news article or video prompting lots of discussion."
– ["Bringing People Closer Together"][5] (Facebook Newsroom)




youtube suppresses the recommendation content that is not suited to be used for ad rolls.
youtube score also rates your "production value"

instagram closes api to keep users within the platform, instagram has the highest engegement rates of every social media platform
instagram copies stories feature to stop snapchat growth, it is just a feature so it can be copied but the different culture on snapchat can't be copied.


aggregator news feeds dont work with video: they are silent and mute sound on playback. this itself shapes the content, resulting in more and more subtitled videos. The context always forms the visual. This is how the invisible shapes the visible. 

live video (fb) results in 6x engagement

the future of video on facebook

newsfeed is for discovery "just browsing", it is passive and unintetional 
"community-driven video"
"shows that give us something to talk about"
"videos are a shared experience" > tv shows



videos build around a group of common interest > fanbase of HBO series

> "(...) we fundamentally belive that video doesn't have to be a passive experience. In fact, we think that video is becoming way more engaging in the years to come as many formats of content can be reinvented for an experience where the audience can participate with the content."

creating pollings, challenges, etc as interactive tools / products


igtv as a result for creator feedback that the 15 sec cap is a problem
problem of cross-platform community building > you can not transfer your views to another platform so you need tools within the platform

different communities on different platforms 
igtv + facebook watch to cross-post to both platforms to monetize
igtv is bootstrapped from facebooks watch platform (only 6 month development time) they could just plug-in

a minute for video in feeds is "long", because feed is for discovery
igtv app is intentional long-format 

facebook watch is focusing on habitual viewing experience that brings you back and creating this loyalty with the content creators, pages get favored if they have the property of bringing people back to the platform 




all content is measured against the underlying social graph, the heart and engine of facebook, that makes this targeting and measurements possible in the first place. so how do networks behave that dont have a social graph at its core?



big audience = revenue share of ad breaks
niche audience = direct funding from "super fans"
branded content = plaform to get brand and creators connected via target audience and "mutual interest"


Cost per thousand impressions (CPM)

creator monitization is linked to "network complience"

subscriptions like patrion separate payments from videos, network performance weights less (but is a "niche").
