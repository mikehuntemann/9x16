# Network-Attached Media

- intro: bridge the pattern of apple and open standards to specific media-network production

- bidirectional relationships, the device and the software are the medium, network itself becomes the genre (viewing habits or habits and tools of production) within that specific sub-genres, prediction vs expectation (vs information itself that is universal but has to be shaped, formed, produced for a specific purpose)

- comparison to Network-Attached Storage as unidirectional, the archive or the database that wants to conserve the information for referencing in the future to provide value in hindsight, because you can not know what might be relevant or valuable in the future.   

- media that embraces referencing / sharing  / copying / iterating / communicating
