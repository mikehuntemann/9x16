# Network-Attached Media

- intro
- bidirectional relationships, genre, prediction vs expectation (vs information itself that is universal but has to be shaped, formed, produced for a specific purpose)
- comparison to Network-Attached Storage as unidirectional, the archive or the database that wants to conserve the information for referencing in the future to provide value in hindsight, because you can not know what might be relevant or valuable in the future.
