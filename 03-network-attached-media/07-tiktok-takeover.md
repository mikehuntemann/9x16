## TikTok Takeover

- Notes to video work, meme-able content

- better than language
- Democratization of mobile video production
- music as the baseline

TikTok musically bootstrapping out of viral, platform branded content within “general purpose” networks > facebook, twitter, reddit

- bootstrapping from virality and music verticality
- don't judge (2015) vs karma is a bitch (2018)
- who owns the meme?
- cooperation vs competition

- Genealogy, Ideas, Patterns, Time
- genre, variation and anti-genre
	- expectation, surprise and disruption

- challenge vs meme?
- "normis"

Virality is a form of synchronization
- "micro-singularities"

- rhythm
- repetition
- habit
- as a means of survival
- what wants to survive?
- the idea, the construct, the pattern, the network


Abundant tools of production, scarce meme (?)
 > collective experience / participation > brand exposure within meme (hard to predict)

compilation as a platform


"Nature prefers simplicity and symmetry"

general editing patterns:
one-take
plot-twisting (binary states) directed by "drop"
more complex sequences directed by rhythm

general evolutionary patterns:
genre / "genre-iteration" / anti-genre
conform or copy / enhance or reimagine / fight
expected / surprised / broken

plus media internal reactions

“ByteDance has accumulated a vast amount of content and social media created by people and rich engagement data across our various products. This massive data is fed into our machine learning algorithms, which further refines the quality of users’ content feed and enhances the content experience, which in turn encourages more engagement and generates more data to be fed back into our algorithms. We use this virtuous cycle to optimize every stage of the “content lifecycle”—creation, moderation, curation, recommendation and interaction.”

the role of sound in Steyerl’s work:
>“One of the reasons [that sound is so vital for the work] is that usually there is such an array of confusing and very very different sources of material which have almost nothing to do with one another even though I pretend. But the only reason why are people able to somehow pretend they go along with this fiction is because the music somehow provides a pretext for doing so. So it unifies, it creates the narrative basically.” - "What is Contemporary? A conversation with Hito Steyerl" published by MOCA (Feb, 2016)


### Memes

facebook as a meme? more powerful version through bigger network

the meme does not help the creator with survival, only its own survival.
you are only the transmission layer, you perform an idea, it is about the idea - its iterations - and not about you.
"(...) a meme is any permanent pattern of matter or information produced by an act of human intentionality. (...)
Memes come into being when the human nervous system reacts to an experience, and codes it in a form that can be communicated to others." p.120

"Memes require only our minds to feed on, and they will replicate images of themselves in consciousness. A catchy tune I hear on the radio may colonize my mind for several days, surviving there thanks to the psychic energy I devote to it."
p.122

"mimetic alleles"

"Let us remember that enhancing survival, in evolutionary terms, means increasing the number of one's own offspring relative to that of other members of one's group." > memes don't do that

"memes force us to react to them by trying to perfect an even better generation of armaments, thus assuring their own replication and survival. And in doing so they exact a price from those who let their minds be colonized by them, a price reckoned in psychic energy, labor, resources, and money. In this sense weapons clearly form to the definition of a parasitic species." p.126

> "a fertile medium of growth" human brain and the network



> "At first, all such relationships between human host and parasitic meme must be symbiotic: The host reproduces the drug because he enjoys it. And he believes that it is he who chooses the drug, and therefore it is he who is in control. Only later does the true nature of the relationship become clear: the human is no more in control of the drug than the trees are in control of the humans whose existence the trees made possible in the first place." p.128

new innovations become demanding and people lose control over it, they started this thing, others will iterate upon once the ideas is outside.
– the loss of "artistic control", DRM

> "Every product of technology takes up space in the mind, and requires some investment of attention that could have been used for some other purpose. Therefore it is vital to make sure that memes are truly symbiotic - that they contribute to our well-being, rather than become parasitic." p. 128

be cautious about habits, what you want let in, what you participate in  
> "The things you own end up owning you. But do what you like, man." - Tyler Durden

Facebook was fun, at first. Instagram was fun, at first. Snapchat was fun, at first. TikTok is fun, you know how this might go on..

### The Selfish Gene: Meme Chapter

The Selfish Gene Explained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9p2F2oa0_k

“Genes are immortal in the sense that the coded information they contain is reproduced, is replicated significantly. [Throughout multiple generations] that there are genes which are identical to what they were tens of millions of years ago. Not the DNA, of course that’s not that turns over in a very short  space of time but the coded information is potentially immortal. (…) The genes who are good at building bodies, good at controlling processes of embryology to make bodies that have what it takes to preserve those genes and pass them on. A body is a survival machine and that is by far the most powerful way of interpreting what an individual organism is.     



“Cultural transmission is analogous to genetic transmission in that, although basically conservative, it can give rise to a form of evolution.”

“By comparing the songs of fathers and sons, Jenkins showed that song patterns were not inherited genetically. Each young male was likely to adopt songs from his territorial neighbours by imitation, in an analogous way to human language. (…) But occasionally Jenkins was privileged to witness the 'invention' of a new song, which occurred by a mistake in the imitation of an old one.”
“Jenkins refers to the origins of new songs as 'cultural mutations’.”

“[Cultural production] all evolve in historical time in a way that looks like highly speeded up genetic evolution, but has really nothing to do with genetic evolution.”


“a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. 'Mimeme' comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like 'gene'. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme.”
p.192

“When you plant a fertile meme in my mind you literally parasitize my brain, turning it into a vehicle for the meme's propagation in just the way that a virus may parasitize the genetic mechanism of a host cell.”

The meme has a “psychological appeal” > “resonates” with our mind

“Whenever conditions arise in which a new kind of replicator can make copies of itself, the new replicators mill lend to take over, and start a new kind of evolution of their own.”
“Imitation, in the broad sense, is how memes can replicate.“

“If the meme is a scientific idea, its spread will depend on how acceptable it is to the population of individual scientists; a rough measure of its survival value could be obtained by counting the number of times it is referred to in successive years in scientific journals.”

“Some memes, like some genes, achieve brilliant short-term success in spreading rapidly, but do not last long in the meme pool.”

Every time a scientist hears an idea and passes it on to somebody else, he is likely to change it somewhat.  (…) Yet I have not repeated them in his own words. I have twisted them round for my own purposes, changing the emphasis, blending them with ideas of my own and of other people.
(…) It looks as though meme trans- mission is subject to continuous mutation, and also to blending.

“I have said a tune is one meme, but what about a symphony: how many memes is that? Is each movement one meme, each recognizable phrase of melody, each bar, each chord, or what? (…)
There I divided the 'gene complex' into large and small genetic units, and units within units.”

“The computers in which memes live are human brains.“
“The human brain, and the body that it controls, cannot do more than one or a few things at once. If a meme is to dominate the attention of a human brain, it must do so at the expense of 'rival' memes. Other commodities for which memes compete are radio and television time, billboard space, newspaper column-inches, and library shelf-space.”

“We should not seek immortality in reproduction.
But if you contribute to the world's culture, if you have a good idea, compose a tune, invent a sparking plug, write a poem, it may live on, intact, long after your genes have dissolved in the common pool.”

“What we have not previously considered is that a cultural trait may have evolved in the way that it has, simply because it is advantageous to itself.”

“All that is necessary is that the brain should be capable of imitation: memes will then evolve that exploit the capability to the full.”

 “The point I am making now is that, even if we look on the dark side and assume that individual man is fundamentally selfish, our conscious foresight—our capacity to simulate the future in imagination—could save us from the worst selfish excesses of the blind replicators.”

“We have the power to defy the selfish genes of our birth and, if necessary, the selfish memes of our indoctrination.”

“We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.”
