##TikTok Takeover

TikTok is a weird creature.
Before being merged together, TikTok was a 1:1 clone of Musically (2014) which was meant to perform and record lip-sync videos within the mobile device. It integrated music samples from their service which no other app was capabale of at that time. The app took of with the #dontjudgechallenge which appeared 2015 as a reaction to a YouTube video "You are disgusting", which then became viral on several social media sites. The three most used apps for this challenge were Vine, Flipagram and Musically itself. Vine could only solve the mobile-only image editing while having only recorded audio from the phones microphone, Flipagram let you compose videos to the music library you had on your phone and Musically provided their music library to the user-base to which you could perform, making the selection of songs more available and frictionless.

After Musically solved the [initial problem](https://web.archive.org/web/20171107015536/https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-musically-2016-5?international=true&r=US&IR=T) of cropped videos – they were 9x16 natively, but the shared platforms were back then still focusing on the 1:1, square format, they repositioned their branding to the center after each clip – which got them #1 in the app store shortly after.
A few years later, TikTok emerges in the western culture, giving the app a different spin. It included more advanced in-app editing capabilities, mostly a combination of video filters and augmented reality features. With that, the focus was not only the performance to music, but content that would "challenge" the user to (re-)produce a certain editing style and performance to a specific music. TikTok works as a Meme-Machine. And it is better than language.

With over [1.5B downloads](https://web.archive.org/web/20191116161829/https://www.cnet.com/news/tiktok-hits-1-5-billion-downloads-report-says/) today, TikTok reaches an international audience, mobilizing masses to contribute to ongoing challenges. In terms of the performance-based characteristics, TikTok seems as the "end-game" to what is the most engaging, most entertaining and easiest to (re-)produce app on the market today.

An interesting shift can be seen within the app. Compared to Facebook and Instagram, were all the content is highly identity- or brand-based, TikTok makes the Challenges itself to the epicenter. It is an event, a happening, trying to get you active and participate. (In this sense, it is maybe more related to Twitter than anything else.) With that, each of the content creators become the transport layer of an idea, which seem to create either a copy of existing patterns, iterations upon existing content or a pattern breaking anti-genre, which resists to conform to the users expectation or micro viewing habit (for each challenge or "branch" of challenges).

The musical rhythm becomes the recipe and driving force for the recording and editing process.
The memes are music-driven. (the music itself or parts of it are also memes) It sets the mood and directs the pace. In my research I found that this music can be identified as "plot twist" music, separating the 15 second soundtrack often into two phases: problem / solution, before / after or other "binary states" or sequences.

a surprise element, playing with the expectations of previously seen footage, this type of media creates the necessity of creating even funnier versions and alterations.

The music supports this plot twisting even by their initial structure itself, for example by an uplifting build into a bass-drop or by further editing the music by heavily overused bass-amplifiers or other editing techniques. sometimes both in combination to more extreme versions. Those kind of sound are often user uploads originating from Soundcloud or bass-boosted versions from youtube. If that is the case, the users name is referenced as the "original" uploader of the song. In other cases, the platform-provided sound features the original musician and title at the bottom.


**general editing patterns**
- one-take
- plot-twisting (binary states) directed by "drop"
- more complex sequences directed by rhythm

**general evolutionary patterns**
- genre / "genre-iteration" / anti-genre
- conform or copy / enhance or reimagine / fight
- expected / surprised / broken

plus media internal reactions
same source different reactions, "chains reactions", asynchronous-produced group performances!


All assets that are used (music and filters) are transparent and available in the interface, giving each user the same possibilities of creation. This can be seen as an evolution and increased capability of the instagram filters which were encoded into the image as such, hiding its references.  

With this "openness", we can see "micro-creativity" at it's best. An atomized, democratized way of producing, bundled with a platform-specific referencing system that


In my case-study i investigated the #karmaisabitchchallenge that got viral within the Chinese version of TikTok in early 2018, which then got cross-platform viral and internationally known after more and more people picked it up and reported on it.

TikTok is not trying to be meaningful, instead it is highly playful. A emotionally-driven, collective experience – on the smartphone.

What Twitter is for expressing and iterating [not cognitive but similar] ideas, TikTok is for expressing and iterating on performances and expectations in short, 15 second timeframes.

Looking at the processes happening it TikTok can make you question the concept of "intellectual property". No-one owns the meme, it is the result of an organic cultural process that creates multiple artifact, which may only differ in popularity. It has a live on its own.

Those emerging viral happenings are a temporary form of synchronization, or so-called ["micro-singularities"](https://web.archive.org/web/20190407203813/https://www.fastcompany.com/3047798/welcome-to-the-age-of-the-micro-singularity). They a rhythm-based, in repetitive production processes in relation to the content creators production and viewing habits. So what is the purpose? The survival of the information itself, the idea, the pattern, and through that the network in which it appears or spreads. The meme can act as the fuel and amplifier of user generated content. It is decentralized in its nature and therefore hard to control. And the opposite is (not true, but close) it is supported by the engagement and performance sensing AI systems.
TikTok (as well as any other AI-driven social media platform) monitors and responds to the unfolding creations and interactions, managing the ["content lifecycle"](https://web.archive.org/web/20180722215334/http://www.bytedance.com/ai/). Interestingly, this also implies / indicates the repetitive nature of the content.

video content on TikTok is machine readable with AI systems, so another indicator that directs Manovich's "video is software"! (2013)

AI senses what resonates the most with our limbic system. We do it unconsciously, without being able why it "kicks" us. The meme itself also has a “psychological appeal”. This is now the fundamental problem of "information asymmetry", were technology becomes "more conscious" of behavior patterns than the users themselves.


> "[Memes] force us to react to them by trying to perfect an even better generation of armaments, thus assuring their own replication and survival. And in doing so they exact a price from those who let their minds be colonized by them, a price reckoned in psychic energy, labor, resources, and money." – The Evolving Self (1993), Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Memes vs Genes, p. 126

Memes need "a fertile medium of growth" but also symbiotic relationship with the host, which is a necessary in the beginning, otherwise we would not integrate them. This relates for mimetic media itself but also for technology and knowledge creation in general.


with this organic replication, we see a loss of "artistic control". Production becomes decentralized and therefore unpredictable.

Nevertheless, this network will and inevitably has to integrate advertising and initiate "commercialized challenges" because this service is also stuck in the ad-business model paradigm.


> “All that is necessary is that the brain should be capable of imitation: memes will then evolve that exploit the capability to the full.” – The Selfish Gene (1976)

habit + UX > as little thought as possible to be able to imitate  


tiktok as ultimate vertical media
"(Mobile Device + Video + UI/UX) x Network Size x AI = Vertical Media"  

"(Always On + Image Flow + Interaction Flow) x Reach x Amplification / Modulation = Flow as Lock-in Mechanism / Prison for the Mind" > this is the parasite.


so what does this all mean for "new media"?
> “The point I am making now is that, even if we look on the dark side and assume that individual man is fundamentally selfish, our conscious foresight—our capacity to simulate the future in imagination—could save us from the worst selfish excesses of the blind replicators.” - The Selfish Gene (1976)
if we can look what might remain valuable in the future, we can escape the now-ness of these platforms and aim for a bigger purpose or goal.
> "“We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.”
