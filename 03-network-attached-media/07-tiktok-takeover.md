## TikTok Takeover
- Notes to video work, meme-able content

- better than language
- Democratization of mobile video production
- music as the baseline

TikTok musically bootstrapping out of viral, platform branded content within “general purpose” networks > facebook, twitter, reddit

- bootstrapping from virality and music verticality
- don't judge (2015) vs karma is a bitch (2018)
- who owns the meme?
- cooperation vs competition

- Genealogy, Ideas, Patterns, Time
- genre, variation and anti-genre
	- expectation, surprise and disruption

- challenge vs meme?
- "normis"

Virality is a form of synchronization
- "micro-singularities"

- rhythm
- repetition
- habit
- as a means of survival
- what wants to survive?
- the idea, the construct, the pattern, the network


Abundant tools of production, scarce meme (?)
 > collective experience / participation > brand exposure within meme (hard to predict)

compilation as a platform


"Nature prefers simplicity and symmetry"

general editing patterns:
one-take
plot-twisting (binary states) directed by "drop"
more complex sequences directed by rhythm

general evolutionary patterns:
genre / "genre-iteration" / anti-genre
conform or copy / enhance or reimagine / fight
expected / surprised / broken

plus media internal reactions

“ByteDance has accumulated a vast amount of content and social media created by people and rich engagement data across our various products. This massive data is fed into our machine learning algorithms, which further refines the quality of users’ content feed and enhances the content experience, which in turn encourages more engagement and generates more data to be fed back into our algorithms. We use this virtuous cycle to optimize every stage of the “content lifecycle”—creation, moderation, curation, recommendation and interaction.”

the role of sound in Steyerl’s work:
>“One of the reasons [that sound is so vital for the work] is that usually there is such an array of confusing and very very different sources of material which have almost nothing to do with one another even though I pretend. But the only reason why are people able to somehow pretend they go along with this fiction is because the music somehow provides a pretext for doing so. So it unifies, it creates the narrative basically.” - "What is Contemporary? A conversation with Hito Steyerl" published by MOCA (Feb, 2016)


### Memes

facebook as a meme? more powerful version through bigger network

the meme does not help the creator with survival, only its own survival.
you are only the transmission layer, you perform an idea, it is about the idea - its iterations - and not about you.
"(...) a meme is any permanent pattern of matter or information produced by an act of human intentionality. (...)
Memes come into being when the human nervous system reacts to an experience, and codes it in a form that can be communicated to others." p.120

"Memes require only our minds to feed on, and they will replicate images of themselves in consciousness. A catchy tune I hear on the radio may colonize my mind for several days, surviving there thanks to the psychic energy I devote to it."
p.122

"mimetic alleles"

"Let us remember that enhancing survival, in evolutionary terms, means increasing the number of one's own offspring relative to that of other members of one's group." > memes don't do that

"memes force us to react to them by trying to perfect an even better generation of armaments, thus assuring their own replication and survival. And in doing so they exact a price from those who let their minds be colonized by them, a price reckoned in psychic energy, labor, resources, and money. In this sense weapons clearly form to the definition of a parasitic species." p.126

> "a fertile medium of growth" human brain and the network



> "At first, all such relationships between human host and parasitic meme must be symbiotic: The host reproduces the drug because he enjoys it. And he believes that it is he who chooses the drug, and therefore it is he who is in control. Only later does the true nature of the relationship become clear: the human is no more in control of the drug than the trees are in control of the humans whose existence the trees made possible in the first place." p.128

new innovations become demanding and people lose control over it, they started this thing, others will iterate upon.

> "Every product of technology takes up space in the mind, and requires some investment of attention that could have been used for some other purpose. Therefore it is vital to make sure that memes are truly symbiotic - that they contribute to our well-being, rather than become parasitic." p. 128

be cautious about habits, what you want let in, what you participate in  
> "The things you own end up owning you. But do what you like, man." - Tyler Durden

Facebook was fun, at first. Instagram was fun, at first. Snapchat was fun, at first. TikTok is fun, you know how this might go on..
