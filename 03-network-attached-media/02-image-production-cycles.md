## Image Production Cycles, Time Compression and Feedback Systems

What I am observing is an increase in the speed of communication and a focus on the now. Trying to understand the fast and complex reality of today seems almost impossible with the amount of information out there.
There is more content created then ever. (add some numbers here) you won't have the time to consume it or further, act on it.
So when everyone is incentivized to create, what is news and what is really news-worthy? only time will tell, and this effect is called the "Lindy" and Lindy follows the Pareto distribution.

> "If a book has been in print for forty years, I can expect it to be in print for another forty years. But, and that is the main difference, if it survives another decade, then it will be expected to be in print another fifty years. This, simply, as a rule, tells you why things that have been around for a long time are not "aging" like persons, but "aging" in reverse. Every year that passes without extinction doubles the additional life expectancy." – Nassim Taleb (Antifragile)

> "So things that have been in existence for a long period of time can be considered more robust/antifragile, i.e., more likely to continue to survive, than new things that haven't passed the test of time"

> "complexity science" as "the study of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects"

In terms of media production we can look at the metric of "time-to-publish" which changed dramatically in the last 10 or so years. It started with text, was extended with photos, now we have video and live-video broadcasts. The bandwidth of possible forms of communication styles increased exponentially.

Time to create, produce and release video content
and where we can see for example a shift from filmmakers to content creators.

- slow time-to-publish (TTP) for image production > digital cameras to desktop (to editing) to browser upload

Here, I want to propose and make a distinction between the different modes of production and consumption:

time-preferences, survival, longevity > relevance

### Analog Film Production
(Slow Feedback Process + Medium Scarcity) > High Risk / Limited in Distribution
Paradigm that inhabits the standard of "you make the film three times":
first when you shape the idea, second when film it and third when you edit it. with each step the "original idea" is shaped by the reality and the constrains of each part in the process.

### Digital Film Production
(Faster Feedback Process (Watch and Reshoot) + Storage Abundance) > TV Pilot for Testing (Risk Management) - Static Sequence
Digital production extends the first paradigm and creates further iterations of the idea within the process of shooting.


### YouTube Video Production
(Even Faster Feedback Process (Shoot, Release, Community) + Hosting Abundance - Responsive Sequence
In the case of videos produced directly for youtube, not just for hosting, we see that the paradigm shifts to a continuous creation mode, we are familiar with from television. But it is not a closed loop in itself, but more continuous loop that can be iterated and changed along the production of each episode.


### Post / Story / Meme Production
(Immediate Feedback Process (All-In-One: Shoot, Release, Community, Hosting)) - Hyper-Responsive Fragment
The more conversational a piece of media becomes, the shorter it gets.
Also the relationship between audience and producer changes because their "distance" becomes closer and closer. You don't produce for "your" audience, the producer and the audience become interchangeable for the contributions to the conversation.  


It is the atomization of content, which I will further discuss in the chapter "what does the network want?" and how the "now" increases the noise to understand..
– the environment that has engagement as a premiss
