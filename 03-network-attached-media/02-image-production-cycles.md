## Image Production Cycles, Time Compression and Feedback Systems

Time to create, produce and release video content

- slow time-to-publish (TTP) for image production > digital cameras to desktop (to editing) to browser upload

from filmmaker to content creator

- Analog Film Production (Slow Feedback Process + Medium Scarcity) > High Risk / Limited in Distribution
- Digital Film Production (Faster Feedback Process (Watch and Reshoot) + Storage Abundance) > TV Pilot for Testing (Risk Management)
- YouTube Video Production (Even Faster Feedback Process (Shoot, Release, Community) + Hosting Abundance
- Post / Story / Meme Production (Immediate Feedback Process (All-In-One: Shoot, Release, Community, Hosting))
