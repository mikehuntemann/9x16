## What does the network want? (General)


The internet has another fundamental problem: monetization. Most social media platforms that survived the initial start-up and venture capital phase have an ad-centric business model or were merged into one. The initial narration is always: scale the community, then introduce ads to generate revenue and support (full-time) content creators to continue and create a media business.

The ad business model is connected to the "time-on-site" metric. The more time you spend on the platform, the more ads you will see, the more money will be generated in the background.
But this gives the network a "perverse incentive" that can cause unintentional consequences.

But in terms of the business model and "user-engagement" I think the companies see it as a natural fit or process of merging marketing metrics, brand affiliations and content production, so I would say it is intentional. And why wouldn't they? They are just "sensing" what the creators and the users want and iterate upon that. This is what Chamath Palihapitiya calls ["not a Facebook problem"][1] but a consumer problem, because users ["have grown addicted to things that are free (...) it's just no expectation [to pay for things on the internet]."

This fundamental framework leads to habituation (or in its extreme form to addiction), by recurring visits to the platform and to certain creators that integrate the companies (and therefore the algorithms) incentives into their media production, which reinforces the expectations of the distribution system and therefore the expectation of the audience.

With this focus on engagement came the emergence of the "social video" or "community-driven videos", as Facebook calls it.

> "We are trying to imagine ways to make the experience of watching a video on Facebook inextricable from the experience of sharing or discussing it." – [Daniel Danker (Product Management Director, Facebook)][2]

Here it is useful to note that Facebook still separates audience from content creator. This paradigm blurs with the concept of TikTok, but I will get into that in the "TikTok Takeover" chapter.

With Live Video as an example for maximum platform engagement, it sets the bar for seamless integration of interaction within a broadcast, resulting in streams of public comments or private chatting with friends (you can also invite) and discuss further in Messenger.

What Facebook is creating are more platform dependencies, guiding / funneling reactions, responses and discussions back into the vertical system.

Ultimately, Facebook wants to integrate everything, therefore content has to be Facebook specific because "native always wins" in terms of efficiency and user experience. An interesting example here is the step-by-step reduction of YouTube videos out of the News Feed. YouTube videos show up half as much as native Facebook videos. Not only this, but in addition to that the YouTube video has a less preferential News Feed integration and previews, for example the missing autoplay feature which creates more friction in the playing process (extended "time-to-play").

> "Ultimately, our goal is to make the video experience on Facebook more social and to build more intention and habit around video"
what does it mean for publishers and creators with Facebook audiences?
community will be the core of video that it affects the content in itself. new content formats and best practices are emerging in this world of community-driven video."

Based on their metrics, Facebook senses that "communal watching" amplifies the experience of watching video content, shared videos from friends are watched 40% longer, live videos together with friends result in longer watch times and have in general up to 6x the engagement.

So one could say that you watch videos because your friends have watched it, you watch longer because you watch it with your friends, and in the end you chat more about it, because you are talking to you friends.
As a conclusion it seems that for time efficency reasons you shouldn't have friends on the internet. Or as Wendy Chun stated: "Friends are a leaky technology."

So how different is YouTube without having a network of friends attached?

back to facebook:

> "The key is always: start with great content. Number one is actually know your audience and use your insights to understand which content is resonating and (...) we are clearly rewarding content that brings people back, which creates this loyalty. (...) And then it's really about nurturing it and for that I would say that Live remains as the best tool we have (...) and then we are seeing that Groups is actually a way to extent your presence as a creator beyond the times were you are actually  directly engaging because the fans make the stories for you."
– [Fidji Simo][3]

their basis seems similar!

The content only seems to act as a catalyst for engagement, which is creating the platform lock-in, because everything is only happening in this one place. But why do we have to have the discussions within Facebook? I think the audience doesn't really care so much about that. But Facebook does: your behavior and reactions can be measured, quantified and you don't get interrupted by other stuff that isn't on Facebook (e.g. the real world, life in gerneral or Facebook competitors).




But what happens when distribution systems change?

### Limits to Openness
building communities, pay-to-reach, gatekeeper creates, manages and modulates the connections within the feed. the Pages "organic reach" acts as bandwidth limitation (which you can 1:1 translate from the principles of the "freemium" filehosting services), definitions of what is "relevant content" changes (values, trajectory, "mission“)

### Pivot to Video
So Facebook incentivized producers and creators to "pivot to video" just by tweaking the algorithm to distribute this format more prominently (video as predominant form of communication) by suppressing other forms.

when videos are getting performance-based, the produces get feedback on their "fitness". this heavily relies on the algorithmic distribution system that filters the content. This is the "curation problem", scarce screen space and time, abundant content.

youtube example, in-transparent indicators > should prevent "gaming the system" > can be updated anytime > not stable, unpredictable

what could go wrong? > "Russian interference", Cambridge Analytica
not a bug, it's a feature: targeting and persuasion, just marketing!

Facebook algorithm changes > "pivot to video" (2015), media companies cutting staff for written content, because short-form video "works better"
in addition to that, the metric for "views" itself was flawed. after an update, playbacks under 3 seconds weren't counted as views, leading to 60-80% drops in view-related metrics.

3 sec (Facebook) vs 30 sec (YouTube) as a measurement of one view.

The proposed model of  
**Machine Distance**  
Research > Developer > Admin > Power-User > End-User  
transforms into:  
**Power / Control Layers**  
Platform (Network) > Developers / Distribution Algorithm > Production and Community Management Tools > Content Creator > Consumer / Audience


### Pivot to Meaningful

> "One of our big focus areas for 2018 is making sure the time we all spend on Facebook is time well spent." - [Zuckerberg][6]


paddle back, de-emphasizing videos again, promoting videos with higher production value
- fighting viral videos, instead "meaningful, high quality engagement"

> "With this update, we will also prioritize posts that spark conversations and meaningful interactions between people. To do this, we will predict which posts you might want to interact with your friends about, and show these posts higher in feed. These are posts that inspire back-and-forth discussion in the comments and posts that you might want to share and react to – whether that’s a post from a friend seeking advice, a friend asking for recommendations for a trip, or a news article or video prompting lots of discussion."
– ["Bringing People Closer Together"][5] (Facebook Newsroom)




youtube suppresses the recommendation content that is not suited to be used for ad rolls.
youtube score also rates your "production value"

instagram closes api to keep users within the platform, instagram has the highest engagement rates of every social media platform
instagram copies stories feature to stop snapchat growth, it is just a feature so it can be copied but the different culture on snapchat can't be copied.


aggregator news feeds don't work with video: they are silent and mute sound on playback. this itself shapes the content, resulting in more and more subtitled videos. The context always forms the visual. This is how the invisible shapes the visible.

live video (fb) results in 6x engagement


what gets seen, gets replicated or distributed (amplification)



Buzzfeed, pivot to viral, platform native content vs buzzfeed.com

the social video

https://developers.facebook.com/videos/f8-2017/the-future-of-video-on-facebook/
the future of video on facebook

newsfeed is for discovery "just browsing", it is passive and unintentional
"community-driven video"
"shows that give us something to talk about"
"videos are a shared experience" > tv shows



videos build around a group of common interest > fanbase of HBO series




https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb6QfpIsXJc

> "(...) we fundamentally believe that video doesn't have to be a passive experience. In fact, we think that video is becoming way more engaging in the years to come as many formats of content can be reinvented for an experience where the audience can participate with the content."
– [Fidji Simo (Vice President of Product, Facebook)][4]

creating polling, challenges, etc as interactive tools / products


IGTV as a result for creator feedback that the 15 sec cap is a problem
problem of cross-platform community building > you can not transfer your views to another platform so you need tools within the platform

different communities on different platforms
IGTV + facebook watch to cross-post to both platforms to monetize
IGTV is bootstrapped from facebooks watch platform (only 6 month development time) they could just plug-in

a minute for video in feeds is "long", because feed is for discovery
IGTV app is intentional long-format

facebook watch is focusing on habitual viewing experience that brings you back and creating this loyalty with the content creators, pages get favored if they have the property of bringing people back to the platform


big audience = revenue share of ad breaks
niche audience = direct funding from "super fans"
branded content = platform to get brand and creators connected via target audience and "mutual interest"


once the network is established, you want to increase the flow within it. workflow, but also direct the flow in favor of the company.


creator monetization is linked to "network compliance"
threat of de-platformation
subscriptions like Patreon separate payments from videos, network performance weights less (but is a "niche").  


And within the research I still see the need for tools like facebook, but not from facebook or on facebook. But the same is true for twitter and others.

All content will somehow be business-facing, with the creation of an business to influencer platform. As a service for businesses, targeting specific audiences. (as the old paradigm of "artistic control")

Facebook became, after a long period of time, an enhanced, socialized and production-wise verticalized version of youtube, with the same business model and the same priniples for content creation as a means of community management. In parallel to that, Netflix is also doing the same, but they risk-manage their own productions by predictions through their feedback-loop with the otherwise passive audience.  

All content is measured against the underlying social graph (or relational databases), the heart and engine of Facebook (or each other platform), that makes this targeting and measurements possible in the first place.

so how do networks behave that don't have Facebooks' social graph at its core?

So what makes tiktok so different from the pre-existing networks?

### Youtube: 10 Fundamentals
Network-attached video (NAV) does not want to be a one-hit-wonder. NAV wants to be repetitive, continuous and branded (recognizable, identifiable, familiar). It wants to be concise in length but also in time to understand, so it favors the easy idea.
Through the network comes interactivity, which leads to a faster feedback loop (producer > community > producer) and a change in language. Direct communication is the ideal form of narration. Speaking directly into the camera, and therefore to the audience. You are also speaking to a specific community, a group of people with a collective interest in something, so be sure that you create content that specifically targets this audience. Your audience wants to see you in a predictable and for you sustainable timeframe, so make sure that you lower your production value to a minimum. To attract new viewers you can always talk about popular topics ("evergreens") or create content with a sense of usefulness ("how-to's").
Another way to a bigger audience is to make collaborations with already popular content creators which share a mutual, community-based interest.

### Loyalty, Community Management and Viewing Habits
While Youtube is a place to host any kind of video content, the tendencies of the network lead to a specific formation of the video content itself (genres, production) and its channel (timeframe). The sequence of uploaded videos becomes the tool of community creation and management (subscribers), which is connected to Youtube as the platform and not to the creator in the first place. A cross-platform community is therefore only possible with additional work and reinforcement. The audience of the channel builds their loyalty and their viewing habits to the platform first and the creator second, due to the multiplicity of content creators around the world.

### Platform Stability, Content Discovery and "Organic Reach"
Changing algorithms for content discovery on the homepage and the trending section were problematic for content creators in the past, who experienced massive drops in their views.
On October 8, 2019 YouTube leaked several metrics of their system, revealing the "P-Score" (Preference Score) which measures and filters every video on the platform for the most engaging and brand-appropriate content to put advertising in front of it. Another internal indicator was "throttling" which limits the videos distribution and its amount of ads.    
And also UI/UX changes of the upload notifications interfere with the video content. By now, the audience has to manually activate channel-specific video uploads.
Platform changes are made by the company and often poorly communicated beforehand. There is no voice from the user-base, neither from the content creators nor the audience.

algorithm changes for content discovery or newsfeeds also happen regularly on facebook and instagram. Facebook especially reduces the amount of people you can reach within your Facebook Pages community. This limit is called "organic reach" and it is declining from year-to-year, effectively incentivizing brands to use paid reach. This metric also favors mobile-first video content, because it has the highest engagement rates throughout all of the media types. (Hoodsuite)


### Permanence, Availability & Censorship


### context, environment, expectations

### Flow-Opimization:Data, Perception, Production
How Flow and Habit are liked:

When social media networks extend their capabilities to video, this is an expensive tradeoff in the first place (processing power and bandwidth, maybe storage not so much). So was is the motivation behind it? What metrics make it a good investment for the company? This again, goes back to the engagement rates of the content:

- "flow" through scrolling photos vs the "flow" of viewing media content within the flow of scrolling
- fighting the meme / viral video > meaningful interaction vs reinforcing engagement
- viral videos increasing time on site
- zuckerberg on adjusting video content, 1:11:00
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boj9eD0Wug8&feature=youtu.be
- video is not skim-able, you have to watch it for longer than a post or a picture, videos resonate more with our limbic system, less abstracted, more personal, more bandwidth, implicit information: body language, voice

Short video formats are going to die or will survive through iterative alterations or memification ("participation" culture).

- fluidity as a medium (apple)


### video hosting is expensive (bandwidth + cpu-time)

### Is YouTube already a legacy service?
> acts as archive for the fast-paced productions within other networks
> but we see additional format which favor the efficiency within production: screen-recordings w/ voiceovers to reduce time-to-publish
> also live-streaming etc.

time-preferences, survival, longevity > relevance
value in the body of work, archive is the store of value , not the content itself > habituation and ephemeral content, addiction, crisis
flow-optimization == engagement

the only way to express yourself is within the content itself while competing with other creators against limited attention spans.
