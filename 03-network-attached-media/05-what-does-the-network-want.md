## What does the network want? (General)

### Youtube: 10 Fundamentals
Network-attached video (NAV) does not want to be a one-hit-wonder. NAV wants to be repetitive, continuous and branded (recognizable, identifiable, familiar). It wants to be concise in length but also in time to understand, so it favors the easy idea.
Through the network comes interactivity, which leads to a faster feedback loop (producer > community > producer) and a change in language. Direct communication is the ideal form of narration. Speaking directly into the camera, and therefore to the audience. You are also speaking to a specific community, a group of people with a collective interest in something, so be sure that you create content that specifically targets this audience. Your audience wants to see you in a predictable and for you sustainable timeframe, so make sure that you lower your production value to a minimum. To attract new viewers you can always talk about popular topics ("evergreens") or create content with a sense of usefulness ("how-to's").
Another way to a bigger audience is to make collaborations with already popular content creators which share a mutual, community-based interest.

### Loyalty, Community Management and Viewing Habits
While Youtube is a place to host any kind of video content, the tendencies of the network lead to a specific formation of the video content itself (genres, production) and its channel (timeframe). The sequence of uploaded videos becomes the tool of community creation and management (subscribers), which is connected to Youtube as the platform and not to the creator in the first place. A cross-platform community is therefore only possible with additional work and reinforcement. The audience of the channel builds their loyalty and their viewing habits to the platform first and the creator second, due to the multiplicity of content creators around the world.

### Platform Stability, Content Discovery and "Organic Reach"
Changing algorithms for content discovery on the homepage and the trending section were problematic for content creators in the past, who experienced massive drops in their views.
On October 8, 2019 YouTube leaked several metrics of their system, revealing the "P-Score" (Preference Score) which measures and filters every video on the platform for the most engaging and brand-appropriate content to put advertising in front of it. Another internal indicator was "throttling" which limits the videos distribution and its amount of ads.    
And also UI/UX changes of the upload notifications interfere with the video content. By now, the audience has to manually activate channel-specific video uploads.
Platform changes are made by the company and often poorly communicated beforehand. There is no voice from the user-base, neither from the content creators nor the audience.

algorithm changes for content discovery or newsfeeds also happen regularly on facebook and instagram. Facebook especially reduces the amount of people you can reach within your Facebook Pages community. This limit is called "organic reach" and it is declining from year-to-year, effectively incentivizing brands to use paid reach. This metric also favors mobile-first video content, because it has the highest engagement rates throughout all of the media types. (Hoodsuite)


### Permanence, Availability & Censorship


### context, environment, expectations

### Videos, Perception, Flow

When social media networks extend their capabilities to video, this is an expensive tradeoff in the first place (processing power and bandwidth, maybe storage not so much). So was is the motivation behind it? What metrics make it a good investment for the company? This again, goes back to the engagement rates of the content:

- "flow" through scrolling photos vs the "flow" of viewing media content within the flow of scrolling
- fighting the meme / viral video > meaningful interaction vs reinforcing engagement
- viral videos increasing time on site

- video is not skim-able, you have to watch it for longer than a post or a picture, videos resonate more with our limbic system, less abstracted, more personal, more bandwidth, implicit information: body language, voice

Short video formats are going to die or will survive through iterative alterations or memification ("participation" culture).

- fluidity as a medium (apple)


### video hosting is expensive (bandwidth + storage)

### Is YouTube already a legacy service?
> acts as archive for the fast-paced productions within other networks
> but we see additional format which favor the efficiency within production: screen-recordings w/ voiceovers to reduce time-to-publish
> also live-streaming etc.

time-preferences, survival, longevity > relevance
value in the body of work, archive is the store of value , not the content itself > habituation and ephemeral content, addiction, crisis
flow-optimization == engagement

the only way to express yourself is within the content itself while competing with other creators against limited attention spans.
