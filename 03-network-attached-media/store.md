### iPhone

With the emergence of the iPhone and its App Store users and developers have the ability to extend the capabilities of the device and sell products directly to the end consumer.
While there was a lot of potential for developers to make money with apps, most social media focused apps came for free, expecting to make money in the future with a growing user base.

In 2011, Apple introduced its first System-on-a-Chip (SoC) the Apple A4 which was used in the iPad and the iPhone 4. The increases in processing power while maintaining very efficient allowed the use cases for HD video and image processing. In combination with good camera quality, the iPhone 4 was presented as an all-in-one (vertical) solution for media production.



### The Basics (2008-2009)

- Chat / Text Messaging / Status Updating
- Push-Notifications
- On-Device Photo Editing


### The Square Picture (2010)

> “Most recently we’re seeing the rise of medium-specific networks whether they be around music (Spotify), text (Twitter) or images (Instagram). As time goes on, I think we’re likely to see concentrated verticals of social networks around different media.” - Kevin Systrom, CEO of Instagram (Nov, 2012)

### The Vertical Picture (2011)

resistance and disintegration: snapchat

Snapchat was started as a counter-reaction to the “social competition” inside newsfeeds and provided an image-based chat design with ephemeral content that would disappear after you have seen the image.
This fundamentally different perspective, which was not based on the newsfeed centric communication, but a fullscreen, close-friend, image-based messenger.  


### The Viral Video / The Vertical Video Syndrome (2012)
youtube as reference platform
amateure videos, no editing, quickly shot, spontanious, fun


### The Vertical Canvas \[Stories] (2013)
image + video + interaction in sequences
"on-platform editing"


### The Vertical Video (2014)
musically, problem of feed integration, branding > cropping

### The Vertical Live Video (2015)
periscope, meerkat, facebook live, instagram live

### Vertical Media / Viral Media

The instant, in-the-moment or real-time nature of these services are a result of the mobility of the smartphone as main driver. This consequently led to the fragmentation or segmentation of media content, to integrate perfectly into the everyday life and the short timeframes of boredom that want to be eradicated. Smaller content increases the feedback loops until everything becomes an endless process, a continuous conversation.

Vertical media is a result of a data- and performance-driven, AI curated, engagement focused environment. This way, the preferences of the network actively incentives "prosumers" / users to a specific mode of production.  

The commodification of time and attention.

The metrics of success have changed. For movies it was the box office, the revenue it would generate after release. Today, success is a matter of community growth rates.

Vertical media is deeply centralized because of the "hosting problem" and network effects.

All media wants - sooner or later - to gain from network effects, everyone wants their work the be seen and their voice to be heard. Owning the attention (within and through these communication channels) is the new version of property rights.

Verticality as a mean of institutional self-preservation, at its core it is just survival.

"(Mobile Device + Video + UI/UX) x Network Size x AI = Vertical Media"  

"(Always On + Image Flow + Interaction Flow) x Reach x Amplification / Modulation = Flow as Lock-in Mechanism / Prison for the Mind"







### VC Funding

Pump and dump = another platform that is going to take off potentially = VC funding
Therefore the narrative of products that might transition into a profitable business in the future.
This led to flipping and merging little apps / companies into the bigger ones.
The narrative will change if this market cycle ends and will lead to profitability focused business models.
This cycle coincides with the emerging digital economies of crypto-currencies and digital tokens, which will inevitably change the fundamental characteristics and "freeness" of the internet.
vs Ad-based business models are the only way to make money on the internet.


### Going Vertical / Becoming an Ecosystem / Platform Economies
You create a product which establishes a network and then you iterate the increase bandwidth within the network to increase the value of each component and participant within it.

“Value is psychological; price is determined by the market.”
Early Retirement Extreme / Economic p.212

If something like Bitcoin is described as a monetary store of value, then Facebook is the store of non-monetary, social value which leverages the scarce asset of attention and the abundant asset of storage and therefore history, where all the long-term value comes from.
(ultra short term, ephemeral, habit > long-term only when archivable)

We see the result of three types of flow optimization:
In the data systems, within the services and infrastructure
In media types that flow in the network and the workflow they are produced
In the human habit of  navigating/ watching or producing

The Hook
>“An experience designed to connect a solution to the user’s problem with enough frequency to form a habit.”
>“If used for good, habit design can enhance lives in entertaining and even healthful routines. If used for evil, habits can quickly turn into wasteful addictions.”


When “Change is the only constant”, why habit?
these systems amplify our need to be consistent with past behavior, and reenforce certain behaviors by prediction.
> compression itself: Prediction of movement (within a sequence of images) to compress most efficiently
So, if we are being compressed, how do we expand or de-compress again?
> self-disruption, do what you fear instead of what you think people will like
> take more risks, create more friction (in your process), introduce more randomness, become long-term orientated, what can provide value in the future and not now?

External triggers become internalized, no need for an external activation function to get us back into the loop.


“Everyday Life is mostly repetitive and unconscious.” > that’s why we can talk about these platforms as technologies of everyday life.

The flow of production does not allow friction at any point.

>“But I tool that from [Reed Hastings (CEO of Netflix)] and I was like, sleep is a competitor, maybe reading is a competitor. Yes, once you get to a certain size I guess you’re competing for time and attention, and the question is, is your use-case looking at photos the most compelling one?”

Jack Dorsey in US Congress Hearing (Sep, 2018)
>“I believe we need to question the fundamental incentives that are in our products today. (…) Every time someone opens up our app, we are implicitly incentivizing them to do something or not to do something. And that extends all the way to our business and those answers we get (…) are going to create massive shifts in how twitter operates and also in our industry.”
