# Framing the Frame

What problem are you addressing:
Inspirations / previous projects:
Trending topics in the media, and how waves of media emerge (via a tulip bubble)
(Do you still care?) How do media propagate, why did the attention dissipate so fast?
Technologies of every day life that integrate well with our habits (morning routine videos)

peaks in the media are getting closer together.
Just as fast as how different content formats are also emerging and disappearing (seems like this is something specific to new media)
Networked attached videos. The videos exist in the network, because their mediation is extended to the audience participation.


Questions / problem:

9x16: Verticality and the Paradigm of Mobile Video
is a case study of the emergence of one output.
A forensic research or analysis of ....
the TikTok challenge.

How do you research this field > what is this field of research, what are research tools,
how did particular new (video) formats emerge in an environment governed by major platforms, hardware and content creators.

The hosting problem.
