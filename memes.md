facebook as a meme? more powerful version through bigger network

the meme does not help the creator with survival, only its own survival.
you are only the transmission layer, you perform an idea, it is about the idea - its iterations - and not about you.
"(...) a meme is any permanent pattern of matter or information produced by an act of human intentionality. (...)
Memes come into being when the human nervous system reacts to an experience, and codes it in a form that can be communicated to others." p.120

"Memes require only our minds to feed on, and they will replicate images of themselves in consciousness. A catchy tune I hear on the radio may colonize my mind for several days, surviving there thanks to the psychic energy I devote to it."
p.122

"mimetic alleles"

"Let us remember that enhancing survival, in evolutionary terms, means increasing the nuer of one's own offsing relative to that of other memers of one's group." > memes don't do that

"memes force us to react to them by trying to perfect an even better generation of armaments, thus assuring their own replication and survival. And in doing so they exact a price from those who let their minds be colonized by them, a price reckoned in psychic energy, labor, resources, and money. In this sense weapons clearly fonform to the definition of a parasitic species." p.126

> "a fertile medium of growth" human brain and the network



> "At first, all such relationships between human host and parasitic meme must be symbiotic: The host reproduces the drug because he enjoys it. And he believes that it is he who chooses the drug, and therefore it is he who is in control. Only later does the true nature of the relationship become clear: the human is no more in control of the drug than the trees are in control of the humans whose existence the trees made possible in the first place." p.128

new innovations become demanding and people lose control over it, they started this thing, others will iterate upon.

> "Every product of technolgy takes up space in the mind, and requires some investment of attention that could have been used for some other purpose. Therefore it is vital to make sure that memes are truly symbiotic - that they contribute to our well-being, rather than become parasitic." p. 128

be cautious about habits, what you want let in, what you participate in

Facebook was fun, at first. Instagram was fun, at first. Snapchat was fun, at first. TikTok is fun, you know how this might go on..
