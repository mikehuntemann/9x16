## The Matrix and the Construct

> "This is the "Construct". It's our loading program. We can load anything, from clothing to equipment, weapons, training simulations, anything we need." - Morpheus, The Matrix (1999)

The Matrix's "Construct" represents a white, endless space which can be filled or modified with all kinds of objects. But it is not without references. The appearing objects are things we already know - things we are familiar with - ideas that already existed outside of the "Construct". They are legacy, historical artifacts, bound or specifically shaped by the physics that exists in the "real world" as well as the simulated world within the empty space.

We can compare this scene in the movie with the emergence of "new" technologies. Technologies inhabit references of preexisting structures, patterns that are repeated and replicated, iterated and extended.

To make a more visual example, let's look at the initial software design of the iPhone and the intersection of software, hardware and the expectation of the user to interact with this device – the interface.
The iPhone's interface could have been completely different. The screen was just an array of pixels that is able to potentially display any kind of images. A white space, a construct of its own.
But what the designers of the iPhone – as a combination of different technologies into a "new" unified product - did was presenting the users a surface they already knew, internally, intuitively.
This mechanism is called *skeuomorphism*, which memes textures from the physical environment into the digital frame, that therefore signals the sense of familiarity, usability and orientation.
