## Platforms and their Origins
In the following I will try to outline the different bootstrapping approaches of the companies and internet platforms that more or less surround us on a daily basis.


The **Internet (1969)** itself is bootstrapping from the telephone lines. This idea repurposes existing application-dependent infrastructure ("making a phone-call") to a general purpose, application-independent infrastructure ("sending information").    

**Google (1998)** is bootstrapping from the internets native hyperlink  and publicly accessible content for its algorithmic curation and indexing of the web.


**Facebook (2004)** is bootstrapping from already verified university email addresses. Only with the existing work of authorization through the universities it was possible to build the base for an "authenticity"-based social network.


**Reddit (2005)** is bootstrapping from the early newsgroups and forums which were often topic dependent and specialized, Reddit generalized this concept.


**Amazon AWS (2006)** is bootstrapping from the "general purpose" hardware stack and combined it into one easy-to-use, "hardware-on-demand" service. Every company had to build and manage its own servers. This was abstracted and scaled through the experiences Amazon made with its own online store.


**YouTube (2006)** is bootstrapping from video-capable digital cameras, which already were in use but didn't had free, public-facing storage on the internet to be shared to a greater audience. Similar media sharing and community platforms emerged like **Flickr (2004)** two years earlier, which is based on photography.


**Twitter (2006)** is bootstrapping from SMS text-messages to make group chats possible and evolved quickly into a service to comment on hashtag-based topics and events.


**Instagram (2010)** is bootstrapping from the Facebook Platform integration for making an account and sharing to the FB friends-list. In addition to that, they use the hardware and software capabilities for photo production and editing that are coming with the iPhone.
The whole service ran on AWS until Facebook integrated it into its own infrastructure in 2014.


**Vine (2012)** is bootstrapping from Instagram and was basically a design clone with the focus on square videos instead of photos. It also has integrated perfectly with Twitter's news feed.
Until its closure, Vine ran exclusively on AWS.


**Snapchat (2011)** and **WhatsApp (2009)** are both bootstrapping from the smartphone's contacts to function as "close-friends" network. Snapchat especially used, like other image-based mobile platforms, the iPhones photo production and editing capabilities.


**TikTok (2017)** is bootstrapping from the concepts of **Musically (2014)** and branded viral videos, that circulate in "general purpose" social media platforms as a side effect. In addition, they both profit from already centralized music platforms such as **Spotify (2006)** which made the management of music royalty payments easier.
