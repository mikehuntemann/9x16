## Patterns and Shifts in Tech

The bootstrapping list could go on forever, but it should be enough to see some of the the evolutionary patterns. We can further generalize the shifts within the platformization in the era of the **Web 2.0**:

**2004 - 2006**  
- Social / Scale / Storage  
- Building Hardware Infrastructure  
- application-based (desktop) to web-based (browser)  

In the early 2000s, the focus of the companies are service-based platforms around specific interest groups and media formats. This is the time of actually building and expanding infrastructure to support such economies of scale. This timeframe marks the shift from desktop application-based services to more advanced, interactive and dynamic web-applications within the browser. Most of the platforms are "free-of-charge", which further increased the speed of scaling of all of these networks.

**2010 - 2013**  
- Mobile Devices / Image Production / AWS Bootstrapping  
- Renting Hardware Infrastructure  
- web-based (browser) to application-based (mobile)  

In the era of the two dominant smartphone platforms, the new companies are all bootstrapping from cloud-computing services like AWS, which helped them to quickly start, adjust and scale in the most efficient way. Renting the hardware reduces the costs upfront and is therefore a viable tool for risk management and experimentation. We also see the shift in the development from the browser-based platforms to the native smartphone app. With that comes the integration of hardware specific functions, which led to an expansion of smartphone-produced media content.
