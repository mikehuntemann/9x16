facebook starts as a social network which scaled exponentially with the help of its mobile and platform strategy.
Experimental devices with deep facebook integrations came to market but failed.
The html5 strategy came to an end in 2011 when they realized, that the way to go forward is native.
Since then facebook is a mobile-first company.

With the emergence of the iPhone and its App Store users and developers have the ability to extend the capabilities of the device and sell products directly to the end consumer.
While there was a lot of potential for developers to make money with apps, most social media focused apps came for free, expecting to make money in the future with a growing user base.
Many apps were focusing on cross-platform social media content production and sharing (via facebook connect, etc.) which manifested itself in the production of square-format media formats, starting with images first and expanding their capabilities to video later. Instagram with its tight integration of facebooks social graph it was easy to sign in and also very easy to share back to facebook. Vine, which was structurally an interface clone of instagram, focused on short 6 second looping videos. this triggered instagram to adapt to the new video format and the square video format was a few months later available for their user base.
The keyword here is timeline or newsfeed share ability. Images that have to integrate and live within the structures of these “content management systems”(?). 
In 2011, apple introduced its first SoC the Apple A4 which was used in the iPad and the iPhone 4. The increases in processing power while maintaining very efficient allowed the use cases for HD video and image processing. In combination with good camera quality, the iPhone 4 was presented as an all-in-one (vertical) solution for media production.

Snapchat was started as a counter-reaction to the “social competition” inside of newsfeeds and provided an image-based chat design with ephemeral content that would disappear after you have seen the image.
This fundamentally different perspective, which was not based on the newsfeed centric communication, but a fullscreen, peer-to-peer image messenger.  

“We want to build a system which is as deeply as possible integrated into every major device and things that people want to use.” - Zuckerberg (Sep, 2012)

“Most recently we’re seeing the rise of medium-specific networks whether they be around music (Spotify), text (Twitter) or images (Instagram). As time goes on, I think we’re likely to see concentrated verticals of social networks around different media.” - Kevin Systrom, CEO of Instagram (Nov, 2012)

“Value is psychological; price is determined by the market.”

All media wants to gain from network effects > new version of property, owning attention


Time to create, produce and release entertaining video content
filmmaker vs content creator

Hollywood Film / Movie
YouTube Video
Post / Story / Meme

Pump and dump = another platform that is going to take off potentially = VC funding
Therefore the narrative of products that might transition into a profitable business in the future. 
This led to flipping and merging little apps / companies into the bigger ones. 
The narrative will change if this market cycle ends and will lead to profitability focused business models. 


Verticality as a mean of institutional self-preservation
The commodification of time / attention


Short formats die or survive through iterative alterations or meme (participation culture)

going vertical
You create a product which establishes a network and then you iterate the increase bandwidth within the network to increase the value of each component and participant within it. 

 facebook is the store of social value which leverages on the scarce asset of attention, human time.
 
 > vertical media is a result of an ai / data-driven, engagement focused environment
> metrics of success changed, box office > revenue vs community growth rates 
> the format of websites became responsive due to mobile visitors, vertical video is deeply centralized (like youtube) because of the hosting + network effects 
 
 
 
 When social media networks extend their capabilities to video, this is an expensive tradeoff in the first place. So was is the motivation behind it? What metrics make it a good investment for the company? What does the network want?

> video is not skim-able, you have to watch it for longer than a post or a picture, videos resonate more with our limbic system
