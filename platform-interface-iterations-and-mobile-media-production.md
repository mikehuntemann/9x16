# Platform Interface Iterations and Mobile Media Production

> “You have to look on things in sequences, it's called path dependancy. The order matters.” - Nassim Taleb

- Notes to installation, connecting the dots
- timeline vs knowledge graph
- mapping the space, handling complexity and parallel processes


### General Trends within the Industry

- Frameworks & developer tools + unified device make it easier create apps on the iPhone + userbase tends to pay more (verticality, efficency, usability)
- Increasing the processing capacities of mobile devices (moore's law) 
- Increasing image quality of mobile devices (second / third order moore's law) 
- Increasing upload / download bandwidth via cellular network (async > sync)
- Increasing bandwidth of communication (compression > expansion)
- Increasing userbase of social media platforms (scale)
- Low cost android smartphones + apps to get mass-adoption (scale)

### Compression 
Time to create, produce and release (entertaining) video content
filmmaker vs content creator

Movie / Documentary
YouTube Video
Post / Story / Meme


### Legacy Desktop Platforms

- slow time-to-publish for image production > digital cameras to desktop (to editing) to browser upload


#### YouTube as Default for iOS

- easy integration due to device rotation
- easy to consume but not good enough for production


#### Facebook as Social Baselayer

> “We want to build a system which is as deeply as possible integrated into every major device and things that people want to use.” - Zuckerberg (YCombinator, Sep, 2012)

platform of scale, general purpose network, "inclusive" to all sorts of content
Facebook starts as a social network which scaled exponentially with the help of its mobile and platform strategy.
Experimental devices with deep facebook integrations came to market but failed.
facebooks biggest mistake: not being native
The html5 (wrapper) strategy came to an end in 2011 when they realized, that the way to go forward is native.
Since then facebook is a mobile-first company.
buying networks: instagram + whatsapp 
(WhatsApp had 450 million monthly active users and 315 million daily active users @IPO)
That are a lot of unique phone numbers.

 
### iPhone

With the emergence of the iPhone and its App Store users and developers have the ability to extend the capabilities of the device and sell products directly to the end consumer.
While there was a lot of potential for developers to make money with apps, most social media focused apps came for free, expecting to make money in the future with a growing user base.

In 2011, apple introduced its first SoC the Apple A4 which was used in the iPad and the iPhone 4. The increases in processing power while maintaining very efficient allowed the use cases for HD video and image processing. In combination with good camera quality, the iPhone 4 was presented as an all-in-one (vertical) solution for media production.

### Two Dominant Feeds, External Production Tools

vc funding, competitors, apps that integrate / build bridges

Many apps were focusing on cross-platform social media content production and sharing (via facebook connect, etc.) which manifested itself in the production of square-format media formats, starting with images first and expanding their capabilities to video later. Instagram with its tight integration of facebooks social graph it was easy to sign in and also very easy to share back to facebook. Vine, which was structurally a clone of instagram, focused on short 6-second video loops. This triggered instagram to adapt to the new video format and the square video format was a few months later available for their user base.
The keyword here is timeline or newsfeed share ability. Images that have to integrate and live within the structures of these “content management systems”(?) / containers / stable formats / medium. 


### The Basics

> On-Device Photo Editing
> Text Messaging / Status Updating


### The Square Picture (2010)

“Most recently we’re seeing the rise of medium-specific networks whether they be around music (Spotify), text (Twitter) or images (Instagram). As time goes on, I think we’re likely to see concentrated verticals of social networks around different media.” - Kevin Systrom, CEO of Instagram (Nov, 2012)

### The Vertical Picture (2011)

resistance and disintegration: snapchat

Snapchat was started as a counter-reaction to the “social competition” inside newsfeeds and provided an image-based chat design with ephemeral content that would disappear after you have seen the image.
This fundamentally different perspective, which was not based on the newsfeed centric communication, but a fullscreen, close-friend, image-based messenger.  


### The Viral Video / The Vertical Video Syndrome (2012)

amateure videos, no editing, quickly shot, spontanious, fun


### The Vertical Canvas (Stories)
image + video + interaction in sequences

### Vertical Media / Viral Media 

The instant, in-the-moment or real-time nature of these services are a result of the mobility of the smartphone as main driver. This consquently led to the fragmentation or segmentation of media content, to integrate perfectly into the everyday life and the short timeframes of boredom that want to be iredicated. Smaller content increases the feedback loops until everything becomes an endless process, a continous conversation.

Vertical media is a result of an data- and performance-driven, AI curated, engagement focused environment. This way, the preferences of the network actively incentives "prosumers" / users to a specific mode of production.  

The commodification of time and attention.

The metrics of success have changed. For movies it was the box office, the revenue it would generate after release. Today, success is a matter of community growth rates. 

Vertical media is deeply centralized because of the "hosting problem" and network effects.

All media wants - sooner or later - to gain from network effects, everyone wants their work the be seen and their voice to be heard. Owning the attention (within and through these communication channels) is the new version of property.

Verticality as a mean of institutional self-preservation, at its core it is just survival. 

"(Mobile Device + Video + UI/UX) x Network Size x AI = Vertical Media"  

"(Always On + Image Flow + Interaction Flow) x Reach x Amplification / Modulation = Flow as Lock-in Mechanism / Prison for the Mind"


### Videos, Perception, Flow 

When social media networks extend their capabilities to video, this is an expensive tradeoff in the first place (processing power and bandwidth, maybe storage not so much). So was is the motivation behind it? What metrics make it a good investment for the company? This again, goes back to the engagement rates of the content:
> "flow" through scrolling photos vs the "flow" of viewing media content within the flow of scrolling 
> fighting the meme / viral video > meaningful interaction vs reinforcing engagement
> viral videos increasing time on site
> zuckerberg on adjusting video content, 1:11:00

> video is not skim-able, you have to watch it for longer than a post or a picture, videos resonate more with our limbic system, less abstracted, more personal, more bandwidth, implicit information: body language, voice

Short video formats are going to die or will survive through iterative alterations or memification ("participation" culture).

### VC Funding

Pump and dump = another platform that is going to take off potentially = VC funding
Therefore the narrative of products that might transition into a profitable business in the future. 
This led to flipping and merging little apps / companies into the bigger ones. 
The narrative will change if this market cycle ends and will lead to profitability focused business models. 
This cycle coincides with the emerging digital economies of crypto-currencies and digital tokens, which will inevitably change the fundamental characteristics and "freeness" of the internet.
vs Ad-based business models are the only way to make money on the internet.


### Going Vertical / Becoming an Ecosystem / Platform Economies
You create a product which establishes a network and then you iterate the increase bandwidth within the network to increase the value of each component and participant within it. 

“Value is psychological; price is determined by the market.”
Early Retirement Extreme / Economic p.212

If something like Bitcoin is described as a monetary store of value, then Facebook is the store of non-monetary, social value which leverages the scarce asset of attention and the abundant asset of storage and therefore history, where all the long-term value comes from.
(ultra short term, ephemeral, habit > long-term only when archivable)
